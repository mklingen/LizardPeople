# 2020 -- Docuseries
EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY (2020) -- DAY

We see a desolate Texas Panhandle landscape with a two-lane asphalt road cutting through low scrub. In the distance there are white wind power turbines, slowly turning in the cloudless sky. In the foreground there are two signs: a speed limit sign reading "80 MPH", and a sign reading "Emmet: Pop. 880".

A beat-up panel van ZOOMS past the sign at high speed.

INT. VAN (2020) -- DAY

Three young people (early 20s) sit in the van. SOPHIE drives with one hand on the wheel. She has a sleeve tattoo featuring occult symbolism, and wears a nose ring. In the passenger seat is MARKUS. He has a goatee and wears a slouching beanie and oversized headphones. MARKUS has a laptop open on his lap. In the back seat is JAMAL, wearing thick rimmed glasses and looking into the viewfinder of a high-end camera. He wears a Texas Tech Red Raiders shirt.

SOPHIE
We're running low on gas.

MARKUS
(beat)
Huh?

SOPHIE
Gas? Should we stop?

JAMAL
We aren't too far, babe. Maybe 30 minutes.

SOPHIE
You know I don't like being called that!

JAMAL
Oh sorry, babe ...y?

SOPHIE
Makes me sound like a talking pig.

MARKUS
Hey guys, check it out. I'm done with the intro.

Markus takes an audio cable from the van and plugs it into his laptop. He hits the spacebar on his laptop and turns up the volume. We hear silly THEME MUSIC with a mysterious, ominous quality.

SOPHIE
(recorded, playing through the speakers)
Paranormal. 
Weird. 
Wild.

We hear a bizarre SCREAM overlaid on the words.

SOPHIE
The fu...?

MARKUS (excitedly)
That's me through a filter!

Markus howls, imitating the clip.

SOPHIE(through the speakers)
Today on Weird-and-Wild: Sasquatch. An animal? A man? Or a legend? Jim Simmons, a "BigFoot hunter" in Texas, claims to have captured... 
(she fades out)

Markus turns down the volume.

JAMAL
That's *fire*.

SOPHIE
Markus, that scream is going to legit haunt my nightmares.

Markus howls again, and the others laugh.

MARKUS
Wait 'till we actually see this dude. Nightmare fuel.

SOPHIE
Jim Simmons, or Sasquatch?

JAMAL
Both. The hunter *and* the hunted.

MARKUS
We aren't going to see a 'squatch out here. There's no  frickin' trees. Doesn't 'squatch live amongst the trees?

Markus gestures to the desolate landscape.

JAMAL
I'll ask this Jim guy where BigFoot was hiding. That should be a good story.

MARKUS
(beat)
Woah... maybe 'squatch likes those big windmills. They remind him of redwoods.

SOPHIE
More to the point, we need Jamal to get shots of the inside of Jim's freezer. Do you think he'll let us?

Markus turns his laptop toward Sophie. On the screen is a picture of JIM SIMMONS (a large, scary-looking man wearing a cowboy hat standing next to an indiscernible blob of material in a freezer).

MARKUS
Just look at this dude, Sophie.

Sophie shoves the laptop out of the way.

SOPHIE
Hey! Get that out of my face. I'm trying to drive!

The engine of the van makes a loud SPUTTER. Sophie reacts.

SOPHIE
No, no, no. Come on!

Sophie hits the steering wheel with her palms. Jamal leans toward the front of the van and looks at the dashboard.

JAMAL
It's ok, babe. This van is just mad old.

SOPHIE
Don't call me "babe" --

We hear a loud BANG, and the van slows to a crawl.

SOPHIE
Dammit! Jamal!

JAMAL
Gas meter must be busted.

The van stops.


EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY (2020) -- DAY

The van is pulled over on the side of the dusty highway. The hood is open, and Markus gazes in with a look of utter confusion. Sophie paces back and forth. Jamal digs in the back of the van for something.

SOPHIE
(looking at her phone)
No reception! We are gonna die out here!

Jamal pulls a red gas canister out of the back of the van. He unscrews it, sniffs, and then holds it up to the rest of the group.

JAMAL
Look! I came prepared. I think there's only a little bit though.

Jamal opens up the gas cap on the van and tilts the canister in. He shakes the canister.

JAMAL
Uh, never mind. It's empty.

SOPHIE
We're gonna die out here!

Markus looks out to the horizon.

MARKUS
Yo... maybe 'squatch does live here. And this is like his ... Bermuda triangle.

SOPHIE
Are you high?

MARKUS
Maybe a little bit.

Meanwhile, Jamal keeps digging in the back of the van. He pulls out his fancy camera and begins filming.

[START CAMERA POV] CUT TO:

We see the scene from Jamal's camera. The camera work is shaky. He focuses on Sophie.

JAMAL
Hey, Sophie! We've gotta shoot this part. It'll work great for the show.

SOPHIE
Really?
(beat)
Right now?

Markus walks into frame, realizes Jamal is shooting footage, and backs out of it.

SOPHIE
(forcing a smile for the camera)
So, uh... we were on the way to BigFoot Hunter Jim Simmon's hideout when our van ran out of gas near, uh... Emmet, Texas.

MARKUS (O.S)
'squatch's trap! Bermuda triangle!

SOPHIE
So now we're going to... I don't know. Walk to the nearest gas station?
(beat)
Jamal! Stop filming! It's so hot! I feel like I'm having a panic attack!

Jamal keeps the frame on her.

JAMAL
Just breathe. Breathe. There you go.

[END CAMERA POV] CUT TO:

Jamal holds the camera as Markus looks out toward the horizon.

MARKUS
Hey! A cop is coming!
(beat)
Oh shit, a cop is coming!

Markus rushes into the van. We hear sirens in the distance.

SOPHIE
Oh thank God. We're gonna be OK.

CUT TO:

!OFFICER CRAIG LANG (a man in his mid 30's, gregarious and good natured) pulls up to the van on a motorcycle. His lights flash. He stops the motorcycle and puts the kickstand on.  He is unshaven and has a stain on his uniform. He takes off his helmet.

LANG
What are you kids up to?

Lang adjusts his belt and stumbles toward the van. Something is not right with him.

SOPHIE
Officer, we just ran out of gas. We need help getting to the nearest gas station. We don't have any cell --

LANG
OK, I hear... I hear you. You know why I pulled you over?

JAMAL
You ... didn't?

LANG
Broken tail light.

SOPHIE
Broken tail light? No, we just ran out of gas.

LANG
Kid ... 
(gesturing to Jamal)
are you filming me right now? Don't do that. Don't do that, my guy.

Jamal backs away and continues filming.

SOPHIE
I think there's been some mistake. We just need help.

Lang pulls out a pad and paper and scrawls something on it. He hands it to Sophie.

LANG
Oh yeah, it's broken. Broken tail light is $30. You can mail -- you can mail the payment to the address at the bottom there. Or you can just hand me cash and we'll call it -- we'll call it a day.

Sophie looks at the ticket, at Jamal, and then back at Lang.

SOPHIE
I am *so* confused.

JAMAL
Officer, what is this about?

LANG
Are you still filming me, kid?

Lang removes a taser from his belt and points it lazily toward Jamal's general direction.

JAMAL
Holy shit!

SOPHIE
(simultaneously)
What the fuck?!

LANG
Stop filming, and give me $30! I'm not messing around!

Sophie reaches into a fanny pack strapped around her hip, and throws two crumpled $20 bills toward Lang.

SOPHIE
Ok! That's forty! Keep the change!

Lang picks up the crumpled bills from the ground, holding his taser in one hand, and nearly falls over.

LANG
Thank you. Y'all have -- y'all have a real nice day. Stay out of trouble.

SOPHIE
Aren't you gonna help us? We need gas!

Lang mounts his motorcycle, revs the engine, and speeds off. Jamal and Sophie watch as he drives into the distance, swerving. Jamal continues filming.

SOPHIE
Did we just get robbed? Did -- did the police just rob us?

JAMAL
I don't think that was the police.

SOPHIE
Was he drunk?
He was drunk, right?

JAMAL
He was drunk. I got it all on camera.

Markus pokes his head out of the van.

MARKUS
Yo, is it over?

SOPHIE
Yeah, no thanks to you!

JAMAL
We almost got shanked by the cops.

MARKUS
Shit, man. Shit. Fuck this place. Bermuda triangle, man.

SOPHIE
What are we supposed to do now?

The college students look around at the desolate landscape, unsure of what just occurred.

JAMAL
I guess we're walking.

# 2017 -- Jim's Exposition Intro
INT. VAN (2020) -- DAY
Markus' laptop sits open in the passenger seat of the van. A YouTube video titled "JIM SIMMONS INTERVIEW -- CRYPTID HUNTER" plays on the screen. In the video, Jim paces in front of a crazy conspiracy corkboard, covered in drawings of outlandish creatures.

JIM SIMMONS (on Video)
Name's Jim. I'm a hunter.

EXT. EMMETT MAIN STREET (2017) -- DAY
SUPER: "THREE YEARS AGO"

We see a cute old-town main street in West Texas. It looks like a mishmash of anachronisms: old West, trailer-chic, route 66. Townsfolk mill about on the sidewalks, wearing flannel, camo, cowboy hats, boots, and Sunday dresses. A fancy Cadillac drives down the main street.

Jim Simmons talks over the action in voiceover.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
What do I hunt? Cryptids. Some say they're only myths.

EXT. VARIOUS EMMETT SHOTS (2017) -- DAY
Series of Shots:
A) An old gas station. CONNIE STANTON (a well-put together woman in her early to mid 20's) fills up her sedan while a dog sleeps next to the entrance.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
BigFoot, Skunk Ape, Mothman, Chupacabra, Pukwudgie. Creatures unknown to science. I hunt for 'em when nobody else will.

B) "Jack's Bar" -- a western-themed bar with saloon doors. A couple of firemen in full uniform walk through the doors.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
Most folks don't *want* to believe in these beasts. They'd rather pretend there ain't nothing on top of the food chain but us human beings.

C) A problematic bronze statue of "the night watchman" in front of Emmett High School, a local legend holding a lantern. JACOB GUNN (a young man in his late teens or early twenties with unkempt hair and a sad expression) rides by on a bicycle with BETH (a young woman in her late teens or early twenties).

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
But I want y'all to see the *truth*. If I didn't hunt 'em, they'd be hunting *you*.

!D) MR. ANTONIO (a profoundly disabled man in a powered wheelchair) sits with his CARETAKER (a young woman wearing hospital scrubs) next to a small artifical duck pond. The caretaker throws bits of bread into the water as the ducks eat. JENNA LANG (a young mother) pushes a baby in a stroller nearby.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
And the most dangerous creature of 'em all, the one even *I'm* afraid of -- it hides among us in plain sight.

# 2017 -- Embezzlement
EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT (2017) -- DAY
We see a parking lot around a fast food restaurant. A TEXAS HORNED LIZARD (a small, squat, draconic-looking beast) basks on a rock. Deep bass rumbles in the background. The screen begins to shake, and the lizard DARTS off frame.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
Reptillians. "Lizard People".

CUT TO:

A fancy-looking brand new Cadillac Escalade featuring chrome rims pulls into the parking lot, blasting deep-bass music. The Cadillac parks askew in one of the spaces, scraping an old Ford Taurus' bumper.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
Nobody knows where they come from. But we know what they *do*.

REGGIE GUNN (an older man with an air of flippancy and cruelty and a receding hairline) opens the driver side door of the Cadillac to look at the damage. We hear the music roaring at full volume.

REGGIE
Sheesh!

Reggie looks left and right for onlookers, shrugs, and turns off the engine, exiting the car, and locking it. The keyfob chirps, and the music turns off. We follow him as he saunters toward the restaurant.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
When a Reptillian arrives, it imitates a human being. It takes its time for a while, waiting to strike.

A police officer, Officer Craig Lang dismounts his motorcycle. He removes his aviator sunglasses, and smiles at Reggie with a look of recognition.

LANG
Hey Reggie, nice ride!

Lang whistles.

REGGIE
Oh yeah, she's new.

LANG
She?

REGGIE
(chuckles)
Love of my life. CVT transmission, leather seats.

LANG
Dang!

REGGIE
You pickin' up lunch?

LANG
Yeah man, I was just fixin' to grab a bite. But I can't stay long. Got a domestic I gotta write up.

REGGIE
Well, let's catch up then.

The two of them walk to the entrance of the fast food restaurant.

CUT TO:

A lone HOMELESS PERSON wearing a cardboard placard stands near the entrance. The placard reads "REPTILIANS CONTROL THE EARTH" hastily written with Sharpie. A crude drawing of an iguana emblazons the center.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
If you don't recognize it in time, a Reptillian can take over a whole town. Then a nation. Then the whole Earth.

LANG and Reggie enter the fast food restaurant, ignoring the homeless person. She gazes at them through the glass.

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
My life's mission is to capture one, and let the whole world know the *truth*.

INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT (2017) -- DAY
Reggie and Lang stand in line waiting for their food. The restaurant is sparsely populated with locals wearing dirty farm attire. 

Lang shows Reggie photos on his phone.

LANG
Check it out. Cynthia got first chair.

He pulls up a photo of CYNTHIA (a smiling girl in her late 10s or early teens holding a large black instrument). Reggie adjusts his bifocals and looks closely at the screen.

REGGIE
That thing looks bigger than she is! What'dya call it? Basso..?

LANG
Bassoon. Woodwind instrument. Sounds like a dying cat. Well, at least it did when she was in middle school.

REGGIE
Well damn. She grew up fast.

LANG
How's Jacob? Did he get into college?

REGGIE
Oh, he's doing his thing. His poetry and whatnot. Good kid, but he needs some direction.

Reggie seems distracted, playing with a ROLEX WATCH on his left wrist.

LANG
Poetry? My guy, you gotta give him direction. That kid is just floating, man. You know what saved me when I was his age?

REGGIE
Jesus?

LANG
Well yeah; Jesus and my old man kickin' me out of the house.

REGGIE
Believe me, I want to, but I don't think that kid would survive.

A RESTAURANT WORKER slides an order onto the counter.

RESTAURANT WORKER (O.S)
(shouting)
Order number 57 for Gunn!

REGGIE
That's mine.

Reggie picks up a greasy bag containing his order. He sips from a large soda in his other hand.

LANG
Hey man, I haven't seen you in a little while. Weren't you setting up a construction gig? Looks like business has been good, huh?

REGGIE
(sipping his soda)
Yeah, I was busy.

Lang motions to Reggie's watch.

LANG
Doing what, robbing a bank? My guy, that is an intense Rolex.

REGGIE
(chuckles)
Oh yeah, big heist. That's how I ruptured my disk.

LANG
Explains why you weren't coaching soccer. And that Cadillac? Damn, guy! Business must be real good!

RESTAURANT WORKER (O.S)
(shouting)
Order number 59 for Lang!

Officer Lang grabs his order.

LANG
Better than I could say for myself. My guy, I am just about *broke*.

CUT TO:

The two men sit down at a booth. Reggie takes out his food, and scatters a number of ketchup packets on the table.

REGGIE
You saw all the construction up on Slide?

LANG
Saw it and heard it. Brand new sidewalks to nowhere.

Reggie sips from his soda, making gurgling noises.

REGGIE
Well, that's my company, Gunn Heavy Lifting.

LANG
No shit? Congrats, guy.

REGGIE
Yep. My own LLC in the great state of Delaware. General contractors.

LANG
Lucky. How'd you land that contract?

Reggie pauses for a moment, and sets his drink down.

REGGIE
Well, I'm also the town treasurer.
(beat)
That's not the only contract I won.

LANG
(scoffs in disbelief)
You ever heard of conflicts of interest?

REGGIE
(eating a french fry)
And you know, from time to time we charge a
(pause)
*premium* on top of the usual.

LANG
A premium? Red carpet treatment?

REGGIE
You know, billable hours.
(finger quotes)
"*Overtime*". You catch my drift.

LANG
You're saying what, exactly?

REGGIE
So let's say my contract is to build a crosswalk on Slide road.

Reggie lines up the ketchup packets on the table, imitating a road.

REGGIE (CONTINUED)
Let's say my contractors take, uh... 22 man-hours to build that thing. They charge me for 22 hours.

Reggie shoves most of the packets of ketchup out of the way, leaving a few extra.

REGGIE (CONTINUED)
(smugly)
Now. I round her up to 30 when I charge the town. Then, mark the extra as *overtime* at 150%. Repeat for every contract, every stoplight, every manhole cover -- You see what I'm saying?
(beat)
That *extra* --

Reggie grabs a packet of ketchup. He SQUIRTS it onto his french fries.

REGGIE (CONTINUED)
 -- goes directly into my bank account.

LANG
(astonished)
My guy --

Lang looks around for anyone overhearing while Reggie takes a sip of his soda.

LANG
(whispering)
You just confessed to embezzlement!

Reggie spits coke all over Lang.

REGGIE
(loudly)
Embezzle-*what*?

Lang wipes his face with a napkin.

LANG
(whispering)
Keep your voice down, moron! You're an elected official. Town treasurer? Embezzlement. Conflict of interest. Corrupt contracts.

Lang counts off on his fingers for each crime Reggie has committed.

REGGIE
(coughs)
This ain't illegal, Craig. *Everybody* does this. This town is in the bum fuck middle of nowhere --

A group of locals laughs at an unheard joke in an adjacent booth.

LANG
(whispering)
Look, I'm just a cop --

Reggie holds up a hand, trying to interrupt while Lang continues.

REGGIE
(interrupting)
Mayor Merril rubber stamped it. I'm just trying to make a living --

LANG (CONTINUED)
 -- but even I know the basics. This is illegal as shit. This is straight-to-jail, four to ten years illegal. If you don't give that money back...

REGGIE
(defensive)
So what?

A tense moment passes in silence.

LANG
And the mayor knows about this?

After an awkward pause, Reggie glances at Lang's badge. Reggie abruptly stands up, clutching his food to his chest. French fries go flying.

REGGIE
(terrified)
I gotta go!

LANG
Oh yeah? *Now* you gotta go? Right when things were gettin' juicy?

Reggie huffs and puffs. He seems panicked.

REGGIE
Don't you have something to write up?

Lang stands.

LANG
I'll walk with you.

EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT (2017) -- DAY
Reggie and Lang hurriedly exit the restaurant. Reggie keeps looking askance at Lang.

As Reggie opens the door, he accidentally SMACKS the homeless person standing outside.

HOMELESS PERSON
Hey!

REGGIE
Dangit.

Reggie and Lang ignore the homeless person and continue walking toward Reggie's Cadillac. The homeless person can be seen in the background.

HOMELESS PERSON
Hey! I didn't ask for money!

LANG
(to Reggie)
So the mayor knows about this. Who else?

REGGIE
(panicking)
I'm pleading the fifth.

Reggie reaches his car and unlocks it. His keyfob CHIRPS. The two men pause for an akward moment.

REGGIE
Look, about what I said back there.

LANG
Say no more. If the mayor knows about it --

REGGIE
I'll give the money back.

LANG
What? No. Don't do that shit.

REGGIE
Huh?

Lang puts his aviator sunglasses back on.

LANG
(low)
If you're in this, I'm in this. I can help you do this smart.
(beat)
I want a cut.


# 2020 -- Weird Town
EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY (2020) -- DAY

Markus, Sophie and Jamal walk down the side of a two-lane country highway. Jamal has taken off his shirt and uses it as a sun shield over his head as he holds the camera. Markus has tied his beanie around his forehead like a sweatband, and carries the gas can. Sophie looks woozy.

We see another sign, "Welcome to Emmet, Texas. Food & Gas 3 miles."

JAMAL
Three miles. Make sure you drink some water.

SOPHIE
Three miles? Isn't anybody going to drive by? (pause) Why hasn't anybody come by yet?

MARKUS
Hey, look at that.
(beat)
Yo, I think that's a park?

EXT. PLAYGROUND (2020) -- DAY

We see a surreal scene: a children's playground with a bare parking lot, freshly painted crosswalks, a sidewalk, and a traffic light. The playground is in empty scrubland with no buildings or trees around.

Markus reads a small sign in front of the playground.

MARKUS
(reading)
Reginald Gunn Playground?

We see the playground, which has a slide, swings, and a merry-go-round twisting in the wind. A huge number of tumbleweeds has piled up next to the slide. There is nobody in sight. A tumbleweed blows past Jamal.

Jamal begins filming.

SOPHIE
There's nobody here. What is this place?

MARKUS
I don't know, but it's freaking me out.

SOPHIE
Do we just keep walking?

MARKUS
I guess so.

Markus shoves the merry-go-round and it squeaks. A tumbleweed flies away in the wind.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD (2020) -- DAY

We see a brief montage of Markus, Sophie and Jamal walking down the road interspersed with landscape shots.

EXT. ABANDONED GAS STATION (2020) -- DAY

We see a burnt out, abandoned gas station on the side of the road. 

Someone has spraypainted across the facade in bright red letters: "REPTILLIANS"

A rusty pickup truck is parked near it. Sophie, Markus and Jamal stand near it and stare in disbelief.

JAMAL
I think it burned a long time ago.

MARKUS
(looking at his hands)
What the hell? Is this real life? Are we dead?

SOPHIE
Oh my God. There's no gas here. And that drunk cop -- I'm getting sunburned.

Sophie begins hyperventilating, and pacing back and forth. Jamal hugs her and tries to comfort her.

JAMAL
Breathe. Just breathe, Sophie. It's gonna be OK. There's probably more than one gas station in this town.

MARKUS
You've been filming this whole time. We're gonna have mad footage of this town. This is some x-files shit, man.

Markus motions to the spray paint.

MARKUS (CONT'D)
You see what that says? "*Reptillians!*" That means like, *lizard people*, man. Reptiles in human suits.

SOPHIE
Nobody cares about the footage. Our amatuer college docuseries is not worth this amount of trouble. Nothing is.

MARKUS
Don't say that. This season we're on Youtube. Next season, *Netflix*.

Markus howls again triumphantly.

Sophie regards him with an air of derision.

SOPHIE
Seriously, how many edibles did you take?

JAMAL
Let's just take this one step at a time.

GARCIA (a farmer, middle aged), exits the gas station from the rear. She wears a baseball cap and has on dirty overalls. She drags a heavy piece of sheet metal.

Sophie, Jamal and Markus YELP simultaneously.

Garcia drops the sheet metal with a CLANG.

GARCIA
(laughing)
Did I scare y'all? Sorry!

JAMAL
We ran out of gas down the road. We need help!

Garcia regards them for a moment, stroking her chin.

GARCIA
Ain't no gas here. Place burned up years ago.
(beat)
Y'all want a ride in my truck? There's gas in town.

# 2017 -- Lang
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (2017) -- NIGHT

SUPER: "THREE YEARS EARLIER"

We see an establishing shot of a modest 1970's-era home with a chain-link fence around it. Like the other homes in the neighborhood, it is squat, brown, and ugly. A bicycle with pink streamers lies on the messy front lawn. We hear a dog barking.

INT. KITCHEN (2017) -- NIGHT

JENNA LANG (a woman in her late 30's or early 40's; she looks exhausted) holds a baby (named MARTIN) in one hand while testing a bottle against her neck for warmth. The baby fusses.

The kitchen looks dated, with old appliances and yellowing wallpaper. A sign hangs in the kitchen reading "God Bless this Mess." There are bills scattered on the kitchen table. We hear a bassoon playing in the background.

JENNA
(to the baby)
Aw, honey. Don't you fret! Mama's gonna feed you real soon.

Jenna bounces the baby. It fusses a bit as she tilts the bottle into its mouth. The bassoon plays a foul note.

We hear a door open, and see Officer Craig Lang enter through the kitchen door, wearing his police uniform. He puts a plastic bag on the kitchen table while his keys jangle. He is hiding something behind his back. When he sees Jenna with baby Martin, he smiles broadly.

LANG
(in a baby-talk voice)
Hi Martin! Who is it? Is it daddy?

Lang leans in and gives Jenna a kiss, and then kisses Martin on the forehead as it drinks from the bottle.


LANG
(in a baby-talk voice)
It's daddy!

JENNA
Hi daddy.

LANG
(whispering)
Wait for the kids to go to sleep before you call me that!

Jenna groans. Craig Lang calls out into the house theatrically.


LANG
(calling out)
Cynthia! Oh Cynthia! I got you a gift!

CYNTHIA LANG (a girl in her early teens or late 10's) enters the kitchen, still holding her Bassoon, which is strapped around her shoulder. It is much too big for her.

CYNTHIA
Let me guess ... a unicorn?

LANG
Better!
(beat)
Well, no, worse.
(beat)
It's this!

Lang pulls a gigantic sugar cookie out from behind his back. It is decorated to look like a turkey, with vibrant feathers.

CYNTHIA
Cool!
(beat)
It's a turkey?

Lang hands her the cookie. She takes a bite.

LANG
Picked it up at the Thanksgiving bake sale just for you, princess.
(beat)
I wanted to eat it real bad, but I didn't.

JENNA
Ooh, looks delicious. What do you say, Cynthia?

CYNTHIA
(chewing)
Thanks, Dad.

Lang ruffles Cynthia's hair. Cynthia wanders out of the kitchen, nibbling on the cookie. Baby Martin finishes drinking from the bottle, and Jenna begins burping it on her shoulder.

LANG
I'll take him. You've had him all day.

Lang grabs the baby and puts it on his shoulder. Before he can get a towel, the baby spits up all over his uniform.

LANG
(laughs)
Oops! Guess I'm doing the laundry tonight!

Jenna begins wiping the spit-up off of his uniform with a towel. She has a look of annoyance on her face.

JENNA
You think you can smooth over showing up two hours late with a cookie?

LANG
Yowza! I told you I was working late.

JENNA
Uh huh, half an hour ago.

Lang pats baby Martin on the back.

JENNA (CONT'D)
This is a full-time job for me too, you know.

LANG
You're right. I'll do better.

Jenna begins looking through the plastic bag on the table. She pulls out a set of diapers and puts it in the corner. Then, she takes out a bottle of wine from the bag, looks at it puzzlingly, and puts it back in the bag.

JENNA
Thanks for picking up the diapers.
(beat)
I didn't ask for wine.

LANG
You will when you hear about my pay raise!

JENNA
Oh really?

LANG
Yep. You're looking at a top performer -- I'm in my prime, baby! If I play my cards right I could be chief soon.

JENNA
Sure. How much?

LANG
Numbers, numbers! She's always asking for numbers! I'll let you know when I get my next check.

Jenna rolls her eyes, and picks up a piece of paper from the table.

JENNA
This came for you. Did you forget to pay the electric bill again?

While holding the baby in one arm, Lang takes the paper from Jenna with his other hand, and looks at it closely.

LANG
Oh shoot! Auto-pay! This is the wrong credit card.

JENNA
Wrong -- ?

LANG
Yeah, you don't remember? We went over our limit on the Barclaycard this month.
(beat)
Bassoon lessons.

Jenna sighs.

LANG
Relax! I'll take care of it. You heard me, I'm in my prime!

Cynthia resumes practicing her Bassoon. We hear Beethoven's Ode to Joy being played out of tune. Baby Martin spits up again, and Lang wipes its chin.

LANG (to Cynthia)
Blow your heart out! You're sounding good!

JENNA
Well, while you "take care of it" Mr. in-his-prime, I am going to take care of me. I need a shower.

LANG
(weird accent)
You're a goddess. Bathe in the mists, my sweet.

Jenna briefly kisses Craig Lang on the lips, and caresses the baby's head, then walks out of the kitchen. Craig sits down at the kitchen table, and starts to look at the bill Jenna handed him.

CUT TO:

A closeup of the bill. We see CITY OF EMMETT, TEXAS MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY across the top.

CUT BACK TO:
We see Craig Lang looking at the bill while holding the baby.

LANG
(scoffs)
Electric bill. City pays my salary -- I pay it right back to the city!

Lang looks at the baby, who sleepily gazes back at him.

LANG
(baby-talk voice)
You think that's fair, my little guy?

The baby spits up again.

LANG
(baby-talk voice)
Nope. Not fair!

Lang absentmindedly pulls the bottle of wine out of the plastic bag. He looks at it, then sets it aside.

LANG
Time for daddy to play a game of "find-the-good-credit-card!"

The bassoon SHRIEKS.

ABRUPT CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN (2017) -- NIGHT

It is much later at night now. Lang's uniform is unbuttoned at the top, and is noticeably still stained with baby spit-up. The baby is nowhere to be seen. Lang is illuminated only by the light of his phone. He is holding a glass of wine.

CUT TO:

A closeup of Lang's phone. He scrolls through social media. He pauses on a dashcam clip of a police cruiser ramming into and flipping a vehicle. He taps on a heart-shaped button.

LANG
Yeah, mess 'em up.

The next clip is of a LARGE POLICE OFFICER in tactical gear standing about twenty feet from a CHARISMATIC POLICE OFFICER holding a yellow stun gun on a soundstage. The charismatic police officer begins presenting to the camera.

CHARISMATIC POLICE OFFICER (ON VIDEO)
Law enforcement officers around the world have been asking me about the new Axon X4 stun gun. With the same range and durability as the Axon X3, the X4 packs quite a bit more punch.
(beat)
But just how much punch?

The large police officer suddenly charges toward the charismatic police officer, who raises the stun gun. Before the large police officer can run halfway to his target, the charismatic police officer fires the stun gun. Tiny yellow darts shoot out of the stun gun, which wires trailing behind.

The darts strike the large police officer, who begins convulsing.

LARGE POLICE OFFICER (ON VIDEO)
Agh! Oh!

He falls to the ground.

LANG
(snickering)
Oh, shit!

CUT TO:

A wide shot of the kitchen. Lang takes a sip of wine while the charismatic police officer continues in audio.

CHARISMATIC POLICE OFFICER (O.S)
The X4 is Axon's most powerful offering ever. At 1400 volts, law enforcement officers can rest easy with one of these in their toolkits -- whether they're on-duty, or off.


LARGE POLICE OFFICER (O.S)
Uhhhg...

CHARISMATIC POLICE OFFICER (O.S)
You okay, Chuck?

CUT TO:

Another closeup of Lang's phone. We see him scrolling through a web store. We see the Axon X4 listed for $2,799. He pauses on it. His thumb hovers over the "Add to Cart" button.

CUT TO:
We see a closeup of Lang's face as he downs the glass of wine.

LANG
Fuck it.

CUT TO:

A wider shot of the kitchen table. Lang turns the phone to illuminate the scene. He pauses on the electric bill, which now has a pile of credit cards on it.

CUT TO:

Lang calls someone on his phone. We faintly hear ringing.


LANG
(slurring)
Heyyy! Reggie!
(beat)
Yeah, yeah I know it's late.
(beat)
Yeah, I was thinking about what we talked about earlier, my guy.
(beat)
No, it's not like that, man --
(beat)
yeah I'm still on your side. I'm still on your side.

Lang picks up the bill from the table, and the credit cards slide off of it.

LANG
I'm calling you 'cause I got an idea.


EXT. TOWN HALL (2017) -- DAY

Establishing shot of Emmet Town Hall. It looks like an afterthought. It is attached to a community center. The building is squat and brown, featuring cinder block walls and those glass bricks that were popular in the 80's. We see a sign reading "CITY OF EMMETT TOWN HALL AND COMMUNITY CENTER."


INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

We see a small-ish room with low ceilings. Harsh fluorescent lights. Cubicles. Fake plants. It looks like Asbestos and nicotine stains.

CONNIE STANTON (a young woman, late 20's or early 30's with well-prepared hair and business casual attire) sits at her desk in a low cubicle. She looks at something on her computer -- it's a relic of 20 years ago, and it makes loud crackling noises.

She has a sign on her desk with her name and title, "Ms. CONNIE STANTON, TOWN CLERK." We see a plaque propped up on her desk reading "2013 Northwest Texas Women's Bowling League Championship. THIRD PLACE".

A landline telephone RINGS on Connie's desk. She picks up the receiver.

CONNIE
(soft West Texas accent)
Emmett City Hall.
(beat)
Yes ma'am. I'll transfer you.

She punches a button on the telephone, and hangs up the receiver.

CUT TO:
INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE (2017) -- DAY

Closeup of decorated cookies on a tray. They are huge sugar cookies, like the one Lang bought for his daughter Cynthia. They are decorated in a Thanksgiving theme -- turkeys, pilgrims, cornucopias, and Native Americans.

The bony hand of MAYOR TRACIE MERRIL enters the frame. Shaking, it grasps the turkey.

CUT TO:

Mayor Tracie Merril (an elderly woman in her late 70's or early 80's, she looks like a gust of wind could knock her over. She has on a festive vest, and her hands shake) looks over the details of the turkey cookie, holding it close to her face and adjusting her glasses to get a better look.

DIANE (a younger to middle aged woman, wearing gloves and a hair net) stands on the other side of the mayor's desk, her hands behind her back. The mayor's office features a stuffed armadillo and a painting of bison on the plains.

TRACIE
Oh my word! Diane, you have outdone yourself. They are just too. Cute!

DIANE
You can have that one, ma'am. My treat.

Tracie puts her hand over her heart.

TRACIE
Good grief! His little waddle!

DIANE
All our cookies are hand made, ma'am. We also do Christmas, Easter, Halloween --

TRACIE
Y'all do an Easter Bunny?

DIANE
Yes ma'am. But the Thanksgiving cookies are some of our best sellers. We're hoping to raise enough to house our homeless through January.

Tracie shakes her head somberly, and then gingerly sets the turkey back down on the tray with an unsteady hand.

TRACIE
Well ...
(beat)
and y'all need help?

DIANE
We could use any support town hall can give us.

TRACIE
Bless your hearts. You know I used to make cookies just like this when I was your age?
(beat)
We could buy a couple.

Tracie presses a button on the landline telephone on her desk. She yells at the phone.

TRACIE
Connie?

(beat)

CONNIE (O.S)
Yes mayor?


TRACIE
(yelling)
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

CONNIE (O.S)
Loud and clear.

TRACIE
Is Reggie in? Can I get Reggie?

CONNIE (O.S)
Mr. Gunn just showed up. I think his son is here? I'll send him in.

TRACIE
Oh, thank you sug'. Thank you.

Tracie turns back toward the cookies and smiles.


TRACIE
Oh... the little Indians. My word!

CUT TO:

Reggie Gunn enters halfway into the mayor's office, while leaning in and knocking on the door. He grins.


REGGIE
Knock, knock! I heard you callin'?

Tracie chuckles, and waves for Reggie to enter.

Behind Reggie, JACOB GUNN (a boy in his very late teens or very early twenties, with unkempt hair and a ridiculous clip-on tie) stands awkwardly.

REGGIE
Now Ms. Mayor, have you met my son Jacob?

Tracie squints.

TRACIE
I am so pleased to meet you, handsome young man!

Jacob blushes a deep shade of red.

REGGIE
(to Jacob)
She don't bite! Come on in.

Jacob shuffles into the room.

JACOB
Hey.

Reggie smiles unconvincingly.

REGGIE
After we attend our business, Miss Mayor, I want to ask you whether we can find a job for Jacob here. You know he's real good with computers?

TRACIE
Oh!
(beat)
I'll be quick. Reggie, do you have the cheque book?

Reggie theatrically pulls a leather bound chequebook from his blazer pocket.

REGGIE
Yes ma'am. It's my job!

TRACIE
(to Diane)
Reggie's our treasurer.

Reggie opens the checkbook and takes a pen from the mayor's desk.

REGGIE
What are we budgeting today, ma'am?

TRACIE
Well ... for this charity. The cookies. I think we could do, what?
(beat)
Two thousand? Reggie, can we do two grand?

Reggie begins writing in the cheque book.

REGGIE
That's in the charity budget. Two thousand. Made out to --?

DIANE
Trinity Church Homeless Ministry.

REGGIE
... homeless
(beat)
ministry.

Reggie finishes writing, and tears off the cheque. He puts it in front of the mayor.

REGGIE
Now we just need your co-signature right here, ma'am.

CUT TO:

A closeup of Mayor Tracie's hand shakily scrawling her signature onto the cheque next to Reggie Gunn's. Gunn's signature looks impeccable and well-practiced. The cheque reads "CITY OF EMMETT, TEXAS; TOWN TREASURY."

CUT TO:

Reggie snatches the cheque from Tracie's desk and hands it to Diane with a smile.

DIANE
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much.

REGGIE
(winking)
Thank the Lord. Glad to help and God bless!

DIANE
We'll have the trays shipped over to the community center -- uh, how many?

TRACIE
Oh, bless your heart. We'll make it ten trays. And -- we can keep this one?

DIANE
Yes ma'am.

Jacob awkwardly reaches in and grabs on, Nighte of the cookies. Reggie swats at Jacob's hand.

REGGIE
(hissing)
Not now, kid. You haven't even been hired yet!


TRACIE
(chuckling)
Oh let him have one, Reggie! He looks hungry!

CUT TO:

Diane has left the office. Reggie sits across from Mayor Tracie. He pulls papers out of his briefcase. Jacob munches on a cookie in the background.

TRACIE
(to Jacob)
Did you watch the Tech game last night?

JACOB
Uh...

Reggie shuffles papers.

REGGIE
Those boys from Texas Christian gave us a real walloping.

TRACIE
It's disgraceful. Truly, truly disgraceful. The way coach --

REGGIE
(interrupting)
Now Ms. Mayor, since I've got you here I thought we could take care of a bit more budgeting?

Reggie sets some papers neatly in front of Tracie. On each piece of paper is a cheque.

TRACIE
Oh?

Tracie pulls the papers toward her and adjusts her glasses.

REGGIE
Just some loose ends we can tie up. I'm gonna need your signature here, here, and here.

Reggie points out lines on the papers where Tracie is supposed to sign.

CUT TO:

A closeup of the papers with Tracie's hand quivering over them, holding a pen. Some of the cheques are made out to "GUNN HEAVY LIFTING, LLC." They all have Reggie's exquisite signature on them. One of the cheques is for tens of thousands of dollars.

CUT BACK TO:
Tracie looks confused.

TRACIE
Reggie, these are some big cheques ... remind me what these were for?
(beat)
Good grief! This one is for twenty five grand?

REGGIE
(sighs)
Yes ma'am. This one is for the playground restoration on Mesquite Lane?

TRACIE
Oh! The playground?

REGGIE
We had a meeting with the planning board? It was early ... you might have still been asleep!

TRACIE
Oh yes, yes! The rusty old playground. On Mesquite?
(beat)
Can we afford that?

REGGIE
Yes ma'am. We're using the state relief funds?

CUT TO:

A closeup as Tracie signs the papers.

REGGIE (O.S)
And this one here is for Jacob's onboarding. New I.T consultant. He's gonna help us with the utility database.

Tracie's hand pauses for a moment, and then she signs.

REGGIE (O.S)
Beautiful, beautiful, almost there! Just a few more.

CUT BACK TO:

We see Tracie silently signing all the documents on her desk. Jacob finishes the cookie. There are crumbs on his tie.

REGGIE
Jacob's girlfriend -- what was her name?
(beat)
Beth. She's going to Texas Christian.


TRACIE
Disgraceful.

Jacob looks like he is about to say something, but closes his mouth. Tracie sets down her pen.

TRACIE
Well, I think that's it.

Reggie smoothly collects the papers from her desk and shoves them into his briefcase.

REGGIE
Alrighty. See Jacob, she don't bite after all. (he winks).

CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

Reggie sets a stack of papers on Connie Stanton's desk. Jacob follows Reggie.

REGGIE
These are for your records, Miss Stanton.

CONNIE
Alright.

Reggie grabs Jacob by the shoulders and drags him up to Connie's desk.

REGGIE
This is my son, Jacob. Jacob, meet Connie Stanton, town clerk.

CONNIE
How do you do?

Jacob forces a smile.

REGGIE
Jacob will be working with us for the next few months on I.T consulting.

CONNIE
Ain't that nice?

REGGIE
(to Jacob)
Connie manages all sorts of stuff for the town. I bet you two are going to be working together real soon.

JACOB
So you're like a secretary, or ... ?

CONNIE
Well, more like a librarian -- actually I'm not really sure. I manage the meeting notes. Oh, and all the databases --

Connie's phone begins to ring.

CONNIE
Sorry, I've got to get that. Nice meeting you!

Connie waves them away and picks up the phone.


CONNIE
(On the phone)
Yes Mr. Garcia. I can see from our records that you did double pay 2016 property tax and we have not yet reimbursed --
(beat)
Happens to the best of us! --


Reggie places his hand on Jacob's back, and walks him out of the building.

CUT TO:


EXT. TOWN HALL PARKING LOT (2017) -- DAY

Jacob and Reggie stand by the Cadillac. Before Jacob can get into the car, Reggie pulls him aside.

REGGIE
Alright. You wanted money, now you're gainfully employed.

JACOB
Ok dad. So what do I do here exactly? I don't know anything about I.T.

REGGIE
(low)
Right now, nothing. You got that? Nothing.

JACOB
Ok...?

REGGIE
(low)
I got you set up as a ten-ninety-nine private contractor. You're my employee, not the town's. Your job is to watch, listen and learn.

JACOB
(disgusted)
Gross. I think I just stepped in something.

Jacob scrunches up his nose and looks down at his shoe. Reggie snaps his fingers in front of Jacob's face.

REGGIE
(low)
Get your head in the game. I want you to learn everything there is to know about the "town utility database".

JACOB
Utility database.

REGGIE (CONT'D)
(low)
That's right. I've got a project for you. You know the lady we talked to in there, Connie?



Reggie and Jacob continue talking over the following:

FLASH FORWARD TO:

INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

It is days later. Connie sits at her desk. She has a new outfit on. She takes a swig of coffee.

JACOB (V.O)
Yeah.

REGGIE (V.O)
Connie's in charge of all the town records. The tax database. The meeting notes. The utilities database.

Connie enters numbers into a spreadsheet. She speaks inaudibly on the phone, which rests between her shoulder and chin.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL SERVER ROOM (2017) -- NIGHT

We see a rack of servers blinking and making whirring noises. Computery special effects overlay the screen.

REGGIE (V.O)
All that shit gets stored in a computer database in something called a "cloud".

The computer screen illuminates Jacob's face. Jacob wears a classic hacker outfit -- a black hoodie with black sunglasses. He rapidly types on a computer as numbers flash by.

REGGIE (V.O)
I want you to "hack" in and steal the utilities database, modify it according to my instructions, and put it back --


JACOB (V.O)
(groans)
Dad, she's probably just using Excel.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

A closeup of Connie's actual computer, which looks ridiculously prosaic in comparison to the servers we saw earlier. Jacob looks sneakily over Connie's shoulder.

REGGIE (V.O)
Well whatever she's up to, I want you to take note of it, and when the time is right, strike.

CUT TO:

We see a closeup of Connie's screen. She drags a Microsoft Excel file into a folder labeled "2017 UTILITIES DATA."

JACOB (V.O)

(beat)
Why?

CUT BACK TO:

Connie leaves her desk. She enters the ladies' restroom. Jacob looks around, and then quickly sits in Connie's chair.

REGGIE (V.O)
You don't need to know that. All you need to know is that if you tell anybody about this, anybody -- I ain't gonna let you go to Dallas and live with your little girlfriend.

Jacob puts a USB THUMB DRIVE into Connie's computer. It has a distinctive SKULL AND CROSSBONES figure on it.

CUT TO:

A closeup of the USB thumb drive blinking rapidly.

REGGIE (V.O, CONT'D)
And if you keep it quiet, I'll give you all the money you need to do your poetry or whatever other damn-fool plan you got on your mind.

JACOB (V.O)
(sigh)
Ok.
CUT BACK TO:

Connie exits the ladies' restroom. She sees Jacob sitting at her desk.

CONNIE
Whatcha doing there, sug'?

JACOB
(panicking)
Oh I'm uh, I'm sorry -- I --

Jacob hits a key on the keyboard, and the task manager comes up on the screen.

JACOB
I'm just doing the monthly updates. Your computer was next on the list.

CONNIE
Oh, ok. While you're in there could you speed up my Internet? It's been so slow.

JACOB
Speed up your -- yeah, yeah obviously! (forced laughter) It'll just be a sec.

REGGIE (V.O)
You play your cards right, and we're all getting rich.

Jacob randomly grabs the bowling championship plaque from Connie's desk.

JACOB
Bowling, huh? Did you win?

CONNIE
Win what? Bowling? No, I came in third. Says it right there on the plaque!
(beat)
That was a while ago.

After an awkward pause, the computer dings. Jacob snatches the USB drive and pockets it.

JACOB
All done! You can go ahead and use your computer now!

Jacob scurries off. Connie looks after him puzzlingly. She shrugs, and sits back in her seat.

# 2020 -- Garcia
INT. PICKUP TRUCK (2020) -- DAY
SUPER: "PRESENT DAY"

Garcia drives an old pickup truck. Sophie sits next to her in the passenger seat. Markus and Jamal sit behind them in the bed of the truck, next to sheet metal and other rusted out odds and ends.

Prayer beads dangle on the rearview mirror.

GARCIA
You came all the way out here from Lubbock?

SOPHIE
We're filming a documentary.

GARCIA
Nothing to see around here. Just old people and crooks. What are you filming?

SOPHIE
(embarassed)
It's about ... uh ... cryptids.

GARCIA
Crypto 
(beat)
-- that computer money?

SOPHIE
No, um. Cryptids. Mythical animals. Like -- well, Big Foot.

Garcia laughs, bellowing.

GARCIA
Big Foot in Emmet, Texas?

SOPHIE
(sheepishly)
It's for Youtube. We're looking for a guy named Jim Simmons -- Big Foot hunter who lives around here?

Garcia rubs her chin.

GARCIA
Is *el Chupacabra* a crypto?

SOPHIE
(excited)
Yes, actually! Chupacabra, the "goat-sucker." It's a legend in Mexico and the Southwest.

Garcia chuckles knowlingly.

GARCIA
I know someone -- Bautista. He's a rancher. Says some man named Jim paid him four thousand dollars to hunt *el Chupacabra* on his ranch.
(chuckle)
Crazy dude. Didn't find nothing. Could be your Simmons.

EXT. PICKUP TRUCK (2020) -- DAY

Jamal and Markus sit in the bed of the truck, bouncing. Jamal looks at the viewfinder of his camera, reviewing footage. As the truck turns onto Emmet main street, Markus notes an odd sight.

MARKUS
What the...

EXT. MAIN STREET (2020) -- DAY

JACOB GUNN (a sunburned boy in his twenties, with unkempt hair and a sad expression) pedals a tricycle down Emmet Texas' desolate main street in front of a boarded up convenience store. 

Jacob pulls a huge placard on wheels behind him. Red and white balloons and tiny american flags adorn the placard, which reads: 

"Re Elect Reggie! Reginald Gunn for Mayor!" 

The tricycle squeaks lamely.

CUT TO:

Jamal films Jacob from the bed of the pickup truck.

EXT. GAS STATION (2020) -- DAY

Garcia's pickup pulls up to a rusty old gas pump. Garcia exits the truck.

GARCIA
Alright kids, you can fill up here, then I'll take you back to your van.

She opens the bed of the truck, and Jamal and Markus get out.

JAMAL
(looking around)
It's getting late. It'll probably be dark by the time we get back.

SOPHIE
(exiting the van)
Do we still even want to interview Simmons tonight? We missed our appointment.

JAMAL
Let's just fill up the gas can for now.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (2020) -- DAY

We see a crappy roadside motel next to the gas station.

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. GAS STATION (2020) -- DAY

MARKUS
We could stay there tonight. Looks cheap.

Jamal fills up the red gas canister.

SOPHIE
No way. I'd rather drive all night than stay here.

MARKUS
(to Garcia)
Hey lady? Did Sophie tell you about that crazy drunk cop?

GARCIA
(scoffs)
Yeah. Best to avoid him.

MARKUS
He just ... *does* that? They let him?

GARCIA
He's chief of police.
(beat)
Don't call 9-1-1 when you're staying here.
(beat)
Oh, and don't drink the water. Use bottled.

Markus puts his hands over his head and sighs deeply.

MARKUS
This place *suuuucks*.

EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY (2020) -- DUSK

Garcia pulls up to the van. The van is still stranded on the side of the highway. The college students exit the truck. 

CUT TO:
Jamal opens the gas cap on the van and fills it up.

CUT TO:
SOPHIE
(to Garcia)
Thank you so, so much. You're literally a lifesaver.

GARCIA
Oh no problem! I needed some company.

MARKUS
So do we like, *tip* you or...

GARCIA
No no no. Just being a good samaritan.

CUT TO:
Jamal starts the van. We hear a GROANING noise, and the van VROOMS to life.

GARCIA
Sounds like it worked! Good luck with your Big Foot.

SOPHIE
Thanks again!

CUT TO:

Garcia drives off down the highway as the college students get into the van.

# 2017 -- Water Heist
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE (2017) -- DAY

SUPER: "THREE YEARS EARLIER"

A construction crew is putting together a playground. Workers fill in slabs of concrete. A backhoe digs. We hear an extraordinary clash of noise.

We see Reggie wearing a hardhat, surveying the workers. With him is a FOREMAN, a construction supervisor also wearing a hardhat.

FOREMAN
(shouting)
Rubber sod!

REGGIE
(shouting)
What?

The foreman dumps a handful of rubber crumbs into a bucket in his other hand.

FOREMAN
The rubber sod you sourced, it's no good!

A phone RINGS and VIBRATES in Reggie's pocket. He waves away the foreman.

REGGIE
Hang on! Gettin' a call!

He pulls the phone out of his pocket and puts it to his ear. He covers the other ear with his hand.

REGGIE
(shouting)
Hello? Jacob?

CUT TO:
INT. GARAGE APARTMENT (2017) -- DAY

Jacob sits in his apartment, which appears to be a converted garage. There are faded posters on the walls, and a mandolin. There are various self-help books strewn on the table in front of him, including a book titled "System IT Administration for Dummies". The lighting is low. He sits at a desk, a huge, curved COMPUTER MONITOR illuminates his face.

JACOB
Hey dad? I got that data you wanted. It's right here in front of me.

CUT TO:
A closeup of Jacob's computer monitor. We see a spreadsheet with the heading "EMMETT UTILITIES DATABASE." Rows of inscrutable numbers fill the screen.

INTERCUT TO:

REGGIE
(shouting)
You're on a date?

CUT TO:
Jacob sits at the desk.

JACOB
What? No? The utilities database. Data.

REGGIE (V.O)
Okay yeah, yeah! The utilities. What about it?

JACOB
I'm not sure I understand it.

Jacob clicks the keyboard a few times with a look of concern on his face.


JACOB
Dad, this account number you wanted me to use is your business account. Gunn Heavy Lifting LLC? Is that right?


REGGIE (V.O)
Just do it. It's right.

JACOB
(unsure)
Uh, ok.
(beat)
So the payments are going to Gunn Heavy Lifting.
(beat)
And you wanted me to swap something?

REGGIE (V.O)
Do you see a column labeled "monthly rollovers?"

JACOB
Yeah, it's column...
(beat)
B?

CUT TO:
Reggie is at the construction site. The backhoe shrieks with ear splitting beeps as it reverses.

REGGIE
(shouting)
Okay, so listen. You're going to take that column -- column C? And switch it with column D.

CUT TO:


JACOB
Dad? I can't really hear you. Can't you just come home and help?

REGGIE (V.O)
No, it's fine. Just swap the monthly rollovers with column D.

A closeup of Jacob's monitor. Jacob's mouse hovers over column B, which is labeled "MONTHLY ROLLOVERS", and then hovers over column C, which is labeled "(2017) DUE ACCOUNTS," the rows are filled with a random assortment of "TRUE" and "FALSE" values. It's all very confusing. He highlights column C.

JACOB
Okay! Swapping C with D.

Several columns go completely red as Jacob swaps the two (incorrect) columns. The entire column "(2017) DUE ACCOUNTS" turns red, and every cell becomes FALSE. We have no idea what's going on, but something has definitely gone wrong.

CUT TO:

Reggie talks on the phone. A jackhammer bellows behind him.

REGGIE
(shouting)
No! I said C -- C as in "Car". And D as in "Dog!"

CUT TO:

Jacob looks utterly confused.


JACOB
That's what I said! Car with Dog. I swapped them! And what was next?


REGGIE (V.O)
Change the overage rate in the top right from point-oh-seven to --

Garbled STATIC briefly cuts his voice off.

CUT TO:

The backhoe POURS dirt into a hole in a cacophany of noise.

CUT TO:

JACOB
From point-oh-seven to what? Sorry?

Reggie's voice comes through the static, he finishes his sentence after being cut off, but Jacob mishears him.

REGGIE (V.O)
-- and two.

JACOB
Two. Got it.

CUT TO:

We see a closeup of Jacob's screen. He edits a cell, changing a number from 0.07 to 2.0. The number goes red. The computer BONKS, and an error message appears.


JACOB
Uh... invalid equation?

CUT TO:

We see a closeup of the USB THUMB DRIVE featuring a skull and crossbones. A red light blinks on it.

REGGIE (V.O)
(shouting)
That's it! You're doing a great job! Now just get that database updated and we can move on to your next task.

EXT. TRAILER HOME (2017) -- DAY

SUPER: "One Month Later"

We see a run-down trailer home. It has seen better days. There are sun-bleached blinds on the windows. A makeshift ramp leads up to the doorway. A CARETAKER (woman in her 20s with a friendly demeanor) walks up the ramp to the trailer, holding a bucket of supplies.

INT. TRAILER HOME (2017) -- DAY

The Caretaker enters the trailer home, swinging open the small door. A television is on, murmuring.

CARETAKER
Mr. Antonio? I got your medicine!

CUT TO:

MR. ANTONIO (a middle aged disabled man, in a power wheelchair, with a tube leading up to his mouth. He is incapable of speech.) rests in front of the television. A television PREACHER is on the T.V. It is a tiny tube television with rabbit ears. A small artificial Christmas tree sits next to it.

PREACHER (on T.V)
Now is the time to open your hearts to the Lord. Feel his strength in the dark times, lifting you up with mighty hands --

Mr. Antonio glances at the caretaker. He blows into the tube, and his wheelchair slowly turns toward her.

CARETAKER
Oh Mr. Antonio, you wouldn't believe all the pain I went through to get this!

She sets a bag down on the small folding table next to him.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)
First, a policeman pulled me over for a rolling stop! He made me pay $30! Cash!

She begins picking trash up from around Mr. Antonio's chair. Empty yogurt containers, a can of beer.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)
Then I had to go to the ATM to get enough to cover the charge at the pharmacy because medicaid wouldn't fully cover you this month --

Mr. Antonio looks up at her with sadness in his eyes.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)
You made quite a mess in here while I was away! You probably had your friends in here for a party, eh?

The preacher continues on the T.V.

PREACHER (on T.V)
A one-time contribution of $500, or an ongoing contribution of just $5 a month from each of our members can sustain us through these harsh times --

The caretaker removes a prescription pill bottle from her bag.

CARETAKER
But in the end, I got it for you!

CUT TO:

A closeup of the caretaker cutting pills into small segments on a tray. She grabs an empty glass from the folding table next to Mr. Antonio. He labors for air.

CARETAKER
Today's the big one. My mama called these "horse pills." So I'm cutting them up for you, okay?

CUT TO:

The caretaker takes the glass over to the sink in the tiny trailer home kitchen.

CARETAKER
Then after we get these down, I'll take you to see the ducks, just like you like!

Mr. Antonio grunts. The caretaker turns on the tap, but nothing comes out. She flips the tap on and off.

CARETAKER
Mr. Antonio, your sink is not working! Is it broken?

Mr. Antonio raises an eyebrow. He looks toward the open bathroom door.

CARETAKER
Good thinking. I'll try the sink in the bathroom.

CUT TO:

The caretaker fills the glass using the sink in the bathroom. The sink gurgles, and a small amount of brown fluid comes through.

CARETAKER
Ew. That won't do!

The caretaker looks at Antonio, who simply stares at her in silence.

CARETAKER
I'll just use Coke, OK? Then we'll figure out what's going on with your water.

CUT TO:

The caretaker helps Mr. Antonio take his pills. He grunts and sputtering as she gets the final bit of pill down. She uses a can of Coke to help him swallow.

CARETAKER
Do you think we forgot to pay the water bill? Maybe your social security got held up?

Mr. Antonio turns toward the television.

PREACHER (on T.V)
And so the Lord God said "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly, and you will eat dust all the days of your life!"

The caretaker looks through an unruly stack of papers on the kitchen counter, and pulls one out.


CUT TO:

A closeup of the caretaker holding a piece of paper. The paper reads "CITY OF EMMETT, TEXAS MUNICIPAL WATER UTILITY" across the top. The caretaker pulls an old cell phone out of her purse, and dials a number she sees on the paper.

CARETAKER
Hello! I'm calling about my water service?
(beat)
Yes, 1326 Arroyo Lane.
(beat)
Oh no, that can't be right. I've got last month's bill right here --
(beat)
yes, I'll hold.


CUT TO:
INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

Connie Stanton is at her desk, the phone between her shoulder and ear. She looks at a spreadsheet.

CONNIE
I'm sorry miss, but it looks like our system shut off his water due to nonpayment? It says here on the computer that Mr. Antonio hasn't paid anything in three months.


CUT BACK TO:
INT. TRAILER HOME (2017) -- DAY

The caretaker on her phone. She now has several papers spread out in front of her. Mr. Antonio can be seen in the background.

CARETAKER
I'm looking at a bill right now from last month that he paid. I just looked at his accounts -- if anything, you've overcharged us in November and December!

INTERCUT TO:

CONNIE
That's weird. I'm missing all payments since
(beat)
September 2017. And your rate hasn't changed. The system says we sent warnings.

CARETAKER
Well the system is wrong. Mr. Antonio paid $65 for water last month!

CONNIE
Holy cow! It says here he should have paid $29. We must have had a glitch, ma'am. I'll make sure his service is restored right away.

Connie begins typing into the spreadsheet when her phone rings.

CONNIE
Hang on, I'm getting another call.

The phone rings again.

CONNIE (COT'D)
Make that two
(beat)
three. Please hold.

CUT TO:
INT. WESTERN BAR (2017) -- DAY

A BARTENDER stands at the back of the bar, talking on a landline telephone. They're holding a phone and a folded piece of paper. Country and Western music plays in the background.


BARTENDER
Hey, this is Jack's Bar at 234 York Avenue. I think our water just got shut off? There's got to be some kind of mistake.


CUT BACK TO:
INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

Connie picks up the phone. Her phone beeps. Lights blink. She is clearly frazzled.


CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL UTILITY ROOM (2017) -- DAY

A SCHOOL PLUMBER in dirty overalls holds a phone to their ear while looking at a water meter.

SCHOOL PLUMBER
The whole dang school system's water has been shut off!


CUT BACK TO:
INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

Connie gets up from her desk. Leaving the phone receiver hanging. She looks around the office and shouts in desperation.

CONNIE
Something's going on with our water system! I'm gettin' like 40 calls a minute!

A TOWN WORKER (#1) exits the ladies' restroom near Connie's desk.

TOWN WORKER #1
Is our water broke? The sink don't work!


CONNIE
(exasperated)
How?
(beat)
How is this my job?

CUT TO:
INT. TOWN HALL (2017) -- DAY

Connie marches over to Jacob's cubicle. Jacob isn't there, but his computer (a beefy gaming computer with blinking RGB lights) is. A can of energy drink sits opened next to it.

CONNIE
Jacob? I think something's wrong with our utilities database! Has anyone seen Jacob!?

REGGIE (O.S)
Connie? Did something go wrong?

CUT TO:

Reggie sidles into Jacob's cubicle and smoothly shuts Jacob's laptop.

CONNIE
The whole town is about to come storming in unless we fix our database! Something got really messed up!

REGGIE
My son had to step out for a personal matter. He'll be back in just a bit. In the meantime, why don't you calm down and we can figure out what happened.

CONNIE
Calm down? I could get fired! It looks like nobody has water in the town right now. I just got off the phone with the medical clinic. Jesus!

Connie begins pacing around outside the cubicle.

REGGIE
Let's not jump to any conclusions. You probably just made a mistake. No big deal.

CONNIE
Reggie, they're saying we overcharged them, but there's no record! You've got to check our accounts --

Reggie creepily places a hand on her shoulder. She stops pacing.

REGGIE
I will do that, Miss Stanton. I don't think you did anything wrong. Could have been a glitch, or maybe you misclicked. Who knows?

Reggie begins pushing her away from Jacob's desk.

REGGIE
I'm gonna talk with the mayor and double check our accounts. I'll put in a good word for you. Don't you worry about it.

CUT TO:
INT. TRAILER HOME (2017) -- DAY

The caretaker is still on the phone. Cheesy hold music faintly plays in the background.

CARETAKER
(sighs)
We're still on hold, Mr. Antonio. They say they're gonna fix it, but who knows?

CUT TO:

A closeup of Mr. Antonio. His lips are chapped and his eyes are glassy as he watches the television. He breathes heavily.

PREACHER (on T.V)
And you know what happened to that Serpent? Revelation 12:9 "and the great dragon was hurled down -- that ancient serpent called Satan -- he who deceiveth the whole world -- into the lake of fire. And all his followers were cast out with him." Amen!

CUT TO:
INT. TOWN HALL, MAYOR'S OFFICE (2017) -- DAY

Reggie stands across from Mayor Tracie Merril's desk. She is now wearing a Christmas sweater.


TRACIE
And the water just shut off?

REGGIE
Yes ma'am. Jacob says the database hadn't been updated in months. Maybe some glitch.

TRACIE
Good grief! You know, back when I was clerk, the man from the water utility -- what was his name? (pause) Anyway, he was real nice. He'd go from house to house, and he'd pencil in the numbers.

REGGIE
Well, those days are long gone. It's all computers and such now.

TRACIE
Disgraceful. People are upset. What do we do now?

Reggie removes some papers from his briefcase.

REGGIE
Jacob will be restoring our database. I just checked our accounts, and unfortunately a few people did overpay before their water was shut off.

TRACIE
Should I call the lawyer?

REGGIE
No need, ma'am. I'll personally see that these people get refunds. But we have to figure out why it was that Ms. Stanton didn't update the database.

Reggie sets the papers in front of Tracie.

TRACIE
I thought you said it was a -- a "gritch"? A "glitch?"

REGGIE
It might be. Look, I wasn't going to bother with this before, but now that we've had this mishap with the database I thought it might be relevant.

He taps the papers.

REGGIE
Jacob found these in Ms. Stanton's browser history.

Tracie adjusts her glasses and squints.

TRACIE
Dubyah ... Dubyah ... Dubyah ... Big ... Ass ... Dick -- Good lord, Reggie what is this?

REGGIE
Pornography, Mrs. Mayor. Lots of it. Vulgar stuff.

Tracie shoves the paper away, disgusted.

TRACIE
Pornographic internet websites? On a town computer? My word!

REGGIE
(sighs)
I didn't want to believe it myself -- but it seems Ms. Stanton has some personal problems.

Tracie slowly shakes her head.

TRACIE
Poor thing. We put so much on her, and she's so young. Her momma died a while back. Lymphoma I think? She used to come to my Mahjongg nights.

REGGIE
Some people just can't take it.

TRACIE
I'll put her on leave. At least until this whole
(beat)
water thing --

Tracie waves her hand, unable to find the right word.

REGGIE
That's for the best, if you think it is. I know a few folks who can cover for her.

TRACIE
Bless your heart, Reggie. This whole town would fall apart if it weren't for you.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL CONNIE'S DESK (2017) -- DAY

Connie packs up her desk into a cardboard box. She sobs. She drops the bowling plaque into the box. Town worker #1 stands nearby.

TOWN WORKER #1
I'm so sorry Connie. You look like you could use a hug.


CONNIE
(sobbing)
I don't know what I'm gonna do!


Town worker #1 gives her a hug.

TOWN WORKER #1
It'll be okay. You'll see. We all make mistakes.

CONNIE
(sobbing)
I didn't make a mistake! -- (sobs) I don't think I did. I always -- I always maintained that database the same way every dang month.

Connie begins walking away from her desk, holding the cardboard box.

CONNIE
I swear, it must have been a computer glitch. Where's that I.T kid?

CUT TO:
INT. TOWN HALL JACOB'S CUBICLE (2017) -- DAY

Connie passes by Jacob's cubicle.

CONNIE
Jacob? (sniffs) Before I go I wanted to show you the database so you can clean --

Jacob is not in the cubicle. The gaming laptop is still sitting on the desk, whirring and glowing in rainbow colors. Connie pauses for a moment, and looks inside.

CUT TO:

A closeup of the USB THUMB DRIVE Jacob used earlier in his hack of the town database, with the SKULL AND CROSSBONES. It is plugged into the laptop.

Impulsively, Connie snatches it, and tosses it in her box. She looks over her shoulder, and exits the cubicle.

EXT. TOWN HALL PARKING LOT (2017) -- DAY

Connie puts her box in her old Honda Civic, and drives away. In the foreground, Reggie watches her go from near his fancy Cadillac.

CUT TO:
INT. CADILLAC (2017) -- DAY

Reggie enters the car. He looks into the rearview mirror. Jacob suddenly appears in the frame. He was hiding in the back seat.

JACOB
Oh my God. Is it over?

Reggie shakes his head and chuckles weirdly.

REGGIE
I had to clean up your mess, but it's over.

JACOB
Dad -- that was illegal. Am I gonna go to jail?

Reggie looks back at his son with a gaze of disbelief.

REGGIE
No, you're not going to jail, and neither am I. I took care of it.

JACOB
(rapidly)
I'm sorry -- I'm not a hacker -- I don't know the first thing about SQL, and I didn't know that the Excel file was actually literally linked --

REGGIE
(interrupting)
I took care of it.

Jacob yelps.

REGGIE
Relax. Your little fuck-up just made us rich.
(beat)
It just happened a lil' bit faster than I had hoped.

JACOB
Rich? So we're done?

Reggie laughs.

REGGIE
We're never done.
(beat)
But I'll pay you.

JACOB
So that's it, I can go to Dallas to live with Beth?

REGGIE
Wait 'till after Christmas. Keep doing your job, and then we'll talk.

Reggie turns on the car. The engine roars.

REGGIE (CONT'D)
We've got to hit up the ATM.

# 2017 -- Pay Day
EXT. BANK (2017) -- DAY

> TITLE CARD (overlay): "THREE YEARS AGO"

We see a drive-through at a small bank. A sign reading "PLAINS BANK OF TEXAS" hangs over the drive-through. The soundtrack roars with UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC.

CUT TO:

Reggie's Cadillac pulls up to the ATM. He rolls down the window. We see a closeup of the ATM screen. Reggie inserts a card into the slot. A screen appears. It reads:

Gunn Heavy Lifting LLC
Balance: $2,452,122.21
Withdraw | Deposit | Cancel

Reggie YELPS with glee and punches the "WITHDRAW" button on the screen.

CUT TO:

INT. CADILLAC (2017) -- DAY

Reggie hands a massive stack of cash to Jacob. Jacob's eyes go wide in disbelief.


REGGIE
That's half. You'll get the other after Christmas.

JACOB
(astonished)
Woah. That's from the water?

Jacob begins counting the cash.

REGGIE (CONT'D)
The water payments, and a few other things I've been cookin'. We'll take it out in chunks. Not too much. We don't wanna attract attention.

CUT TO:

The car is now parked. Reggie stuffs another stack of cash into an unmarked envelope.

SMASH CUT TO:


EXT. OFFICER LANG'S HOUSE (2017) -- NIGHT

We see a closeup of that same envelope. Reggie takes a $100 bill out of it and puts  it into a glass jar labeled "BAND CAMP FUND." Under the label is a link to a GoFundMe page.

CUT TO:

We see a child's birthday party. Kids run around the modest yard of the Lang family's house. Adults stand around chatting, some with beers in their hands.

Reggie stands next to a folding table with a paper placemat. He wears a white blazer. On the table are frosted cupcakes, and the jar in which he's just placed the envelope. Jenna Lang stands nearby chatting inaudibly with party guests.

Jenna notices Reggie placing the envelope in the jar, and turns to Reggie.

JENNA
Reggie! I didn't know you were coming!

Reggie' beams. It's clear he's putting on a show.

REGGIE
Well good evenin' Mrs. Lang. Just thought I'd sneak in. Maybe grab one of them cupcakes.

JENNA
Please, stay as long as you want! Craig's in the garage.

Reggie swipes a cupcake from the table.

REGGIE
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

Jenna motions to the glass jar in which Reggie has just placed the $100 bill.

JENNA
And the donation -- thanks but you really didn't have to.

Reggie leans in close, cupcake in hand.

REGGIE
(low)
Look, Craig hasn't said anything outright -- but I understand y'all are going through hard times. I wanted to help out the birthday girl.

JENNA
(uncomfortably)
Things ain't so hard as that. It's just band camp!

Reggie shoves the whole cupcake in his mouth, and pats Jenna on the back, then walks out of frame.


INT. GARAGE (2017) -- NIGHT

Officer Craig Lang stands with three other men (FIREMAN #2, and FIRE MARSHAL CORNYN) in the garage. They are all wearing comically small party hats. Lang holds a glass of hard liquor. The three men admire Lang's police motorcycle. One of the men, FIRE MARSHAL CORNYN (muscle bound male, 40s), is bent over the motorcycle, his butt crack showing.

CORNYN
(whistling)
You keep this sucker well oiled!

LANG
I gotta catch those bad guys somehow.

Cornyn gets up from the ground. He holds an oily rag.

CORNYN
I picked the wrong service. I can't take the fire engine on joyrides. You're just cruisin' 'round town on this hog!

Lang laughs.

CORNYN (CONT'D)
Boy, I seen you wearin' them aviators buzzin' by the fire station at 80, 90 miles per hour? Where are you goin' to so fast?

FIREMAN #2 imitates the sound of a roaring motorcycle.

LANG
I get to the fires before you do, my guy.

FIREMAN #2
Yo Craig, did you get that badass taser you were talking about? I wanna try it.

LANG
Just came in!

Lang moves aside tools on his workbench, and pulls out a box that was hidden behind them.

CUT TO:

Lang opens the box. It is a plastic case with a prominent logo reading "AXON X4" on the front. Inside, the yellow Taser sits neatly.

LANG (CONTINUED)
I couldn't get the chief to agree to a purchase order, so I just bought it myself with a credit card.

CUT TO: 

LANG
(removing the taser)
Don't tell Jenna.

FIREMAN #2
Dang! Is it your wallet, or *hers*, man?

Cornyn examines the taser. He whistles.

CORNYN
That is one badass mofo.

Lang smiles wrily, loading the Taser.

CORNYN (CONTINUED)
I'll pay you fiddy bucks to shoot me with it.

Cornyn makes a show of removing his wallet. Lang snickers.

LANG
Nah, my guy. It's dangerous. You could get burns, die even!

Cornyn beats his chest like a Gorilla.

CORNYN
Fiddy bucks! I ain't chicken. Aim right here on these pectorals. It'll bounce *right off*.

FIREMAN #2
Man, you crazy.

CUT TO:

Reggie enters the garage. Lang still holds the taser as Cornyn boasts.

REGGIE
Hey, fellas. Am I interrupting?

CORNYN
(to Reggie)
Well if it ain't Gunn Heavy Liftin'!

Lang glances uncomfortably at Reggie, and then at the ground. He almost looks ashamed. He puts the taser away.

LANG
My guy, I wasn't expecting you to show up.

REGGIE
(grinning)
You think I'd miss an excuse to drink with my buds on a Tuesday night?

Fireman #2 lifts his beer into the air.

FIREMAN #2
Amen to that!
(beat)
Oh, and happy birthday to Cynthia.

CORNYN
(to Reggie)
I hear y'all are makin' big bucks these days.

REGGIE
Business is good. Speaking of which --

Reggie motions to the garage door behind him.

REGGIE (CONTINUED)
You boys mind if Craig and I catch up? Business stuff.

EXT. OFFICER LANG'S HOUSE (2017) -- NIGHT

Lang and Reggie stand in a dark corner next to Lang's house. After looking around to make sure nobody is watching, Reggie places his hand on Lang's shoulder.

REGGIE
(low growl)
Your plan worked.

LANG
My plan?

REGGIE
You're a *genius*. Skimming the water bills -- it actually worked!

Lang backs away.

LANG
Oh God! I was drunk. I didn't actually think --
Wait are you saying -- ?

REGGIE
It worked even better than your drunk ass could have imagined.
(beat)
Just relax. I'm givin' you a cut. Just like you wanted.

Lang seems deeply anxious.

LANG
Okay, okay.
(beat)
I don't want to know *one thing more* about what you did. Even being associated with something like this is a --

REGGIE
(interrupting)
You don't have to know. Nobody has to know. But I want you to have your money.

Lang pauses, considering.

LANG
How much?

REGGIE
I'm giving you sixty.

LANG
Percent?

REGGIE
Thousand.

LANG
(low)
Holy --

CUT TO:
Children run in the yard. Cynthia wears a blindfold and plays a party game with friends. Their parents laugh as they watch the scene unfold.

CUT BACK TO:

Lang hesitates. He can't find the right words to respond to this new information.

LANG (CONTINUED)
My guy, you can't just give me sixty grand. Not here. Not tonight. You need to at least launder --

Reggie interrupts him again with a firmly raised hand.

REGGIE
You settin' up that band camp fund? That was a sign. I put a little *finders fee* in there for ya.

LANG
Band camp doesn't cost sixty thousand dollars!

REGGIE
I know. I know. I put $100 in there. This is how I'm gonna do it. Little things. A thousand here, a thousand there. It'll be easier if we do it electronically.

Lang considers for a moment.

LANG
Well, we'd need an innocent-sounding front where I could take payments.

CUT TO:

A party guest puts a $5 bill in the band camp fund.


LANG (V.O)
(beat)
The GoFundMe! I set it up for Cynthia!

REGGIE (V.O)
Bingo. Easy money. Untraceable.

We see the link to the GoFundMe page.

CUT TO:

The GoFundMe page is superimposed on the screen. It is titled "Cynthia's Basson Lesson Fund". There is a cute picture of cynthia holding her bassoon on the front.

A dollar amount is listed prominently on the page. It begins to tick up in small increments. Each time it ticks up, there is a PING.

LANG (V.O)
Okay. Nobody has to know.

REGGIE (V.O)
Now you get it. I'll put some in there. Then, when you need more, you just set up another one. Then another, and another, and another. Use a fake name if you have to.


# 2020 -- Going Viral
INT. VAN (2020) -- DUSK

SUPER: "PRESENT DAY"

The college students sit in the van. Jamal sits in the driver seat, Markus in the passenger seat, and Sophie in the rear seat now.

SOPHIE
Ok. What now? We lost like a whole day.

She checks her phone.

SOPHIE (CONT'D)
Summer break is over in like ... two weeks and we barely have anything filmed.

JAMAL
(sighs)
Let's just go to that motel. I've got video to upload.

SOPHIE
Maybe we should just make our documentary about something else?

Markus pulls a bag out of the glove box. It is a bag of gummies.

MARKUS
(disappointed)
They melted!

He munches on one anyway.

JAMAL
I'm not scared of one motorcycle cop in the middle of nowhere.

Jamal puts the van in gear.

JAMAL
You said it yourself. We have two weeks to throw this together. Let's just stick to the plan.

SOPHIE
(sigh)
Fine.

EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY (2020) -- DUSK

The van drives down the highway, past the sign reading "Welome to Emmet, Texas".

CUT TO:

A Texas HORNED LIZARD basks in the sun in the foreground, with the sign out of focus in the background.

EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT (2020) -- NIGHT

The van pulls into a parking space at the seedy roadside hotel. A neon sign reads "VACANCIES". The van is sputtering. Something is clearly mechanically wrong with it.

JAMAL (V.O)
Made it!

FADE TO:

EXT. MOTEL PARKLING LOT, ACROSS THE STREET (2020) - NIGHT

As the college students exit the van, Officer Lang sits on his motorcycle in darkness, his silhouette illuminated by the neon lights.

SOPHIE (V.O)
This van is *so* janky!

Lang watches them, and then takes a swig of whiskey from a flask.

INT. MOTEL ROOM (2020) -- DAY

Sophie wakes up in the morning light in a cheap hotel room. It looks like the sort of place where bedbugs meet to do crime. Jamal and Markus snore. Sophie sees Jamal curled up on a floral couch. She sees Markus in the other bed. Markus' laptop sits at the foot of the bed, open.

CUT TO:

Sophie turns on the motel sink. It GURGLES, and awful brown water burbles out of it.

SOPHIE
Ew!

JAMAL (O.S)
Huh?

CUT TO:

Jamal stretches, and rises from the couch. Sophie shows him a glass of disgusting brown liquid.

JAMAL
Aw dang. That lady said not to drink the water.

SOPHIE
(examining the glass)
Nasty.

Markus' laptop DINGS. The screen turns on.

Markus groans, stretches, and pulls the laptop toward him.

MARKUS
You guys --

SOPHIE
(to Jamal)
We need to get going. It's like ten AM.

JAMAL
Yeah, breakfast?

MARKUS (CONT'D)
You guys, we went *viral*.

JAMAL
(to Markus)
What are you talking about?

Markus turns his laptop toward Sophie and Jamal.

MARKUS
Five *million* views and climbing.

JAMAL
You uploaded something?

CUT TO:

We see a Youtube page titled "CRAZY DRUNK COP IN EMMET, TEXAS - GONE NUTS!" 

The video plays. The video rapidly cuts between footage that Jamal took of Lang robbing the college students, footage of Jacob on the tricycle, the playground, and Sophie complaining. We hear zany sound effects.

The last shot 

MARKUS (O.S)
I couldn't sleep last night, so I just started editing.

CUT TO:

SOPHIE
Did you say five *million*?

MARKUS
We got like a thousand comments already. Mostly bullshit, but there's some good ones.

Markus scrolls on his laptop.

JAMAL
*This* is what makes us go viral?

MARKUS
(reading)
This one says: "Yo, I've been through Emmet. Hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife."

Sophie grabs the laptop from Markus.

SOPHIE
(reading)
There's a lot of comments about me.

JAMAL
Babe, *never* read those ones.

SOPHIE (CONT'D)
(reading)
"Emmet is run by *lizard people*?"
(beat)
"Fuck Reggie Gunn?"

JAMAL
(scrolling on his phone)
Okay, okay. Our Twitter is blowing up.

SOPHIE (CONT'D)
Woah, there's a rant by Jim Simmons in here!

Jamal scrolls through his phone excitedly.

JAMAL (CONT'D)
I just got an email from someone at the Ft. Worth Star Telegram.
(beat)
They want to pay us for our video?

MARKUS
Nah, man. Hold out for the big fish. N.B.C, freakin' *Netflix* man.

Suddenly, we hear a loug BANG on the door. BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!

CORNYN (O.S)
(shouting)
Open up!

MARKUS
(petrified)
Oh no, no, no. He's back.

Jamal walks to the door and looks through the peephole.

[START PEEPHOLE POV] CUT TO:

We see two burly firemen (FIRE MARSHAL CORNYN (muscle bound male, 40s), and FIREMAN #2) in matching fire department T-shirts and firemen's pants standing in front of the motel door from the perspective of the peephole.

[END PEEPHOLE POV] CUT BACK TO:

JAMAL
It's ok. It's just the fire department.

Jamal opens the door.

CORNYN
You the college kids?

JAMAL
(confused)
Uh...

CORNYN (CONT'D)
Filming a documentary?

A tense moment passes between them.

JAMAL
Yeah?

Cornyn and Fireman #2 PUSH past Jamal roughly and enter the motel room. They seem intent on violence.

CORNYN
(shouting)
Where is it?

SOPHIE
(surprised)
Oh my God -- *what*?

Fireman #2 rummages through the items in the room, dumping out Markus' bag.

MARKUS
Hey!

Cornyn gets between Markus and his bag. The sheer size difference between the two is enough to make Markus back away slowly.

CORNYN
You filmed a police officer yesterday. Where's your footage?

Fireman #2 finds a plastic baggie of weed in Markus' bag. He sniffs it, then pockets it.

MARKUS
(appalled)
That's my stuff, man!

JAMAL
(to Cornyn)
Okay man, don't hurt us. I've got it.

Jamal grabs his camera bag, and pulls out a small SD CARD. He shows it to Cornyn.

JAMAL
It's here. It's here, ok?

CORNYN
(menacing)
Show me.

While this is happening, Sophie hyperventilates.

SOPHIE
Who the hell *are you*? What do you want?

Cornyn ignores her. Jamal puts the SD card into his camera, and turns it on. The footage of Officer Lang plays on the viewfinder.

CORNYN
Hand it over.

JAMAL
(scared)
Ok!

Jamal takes the SD card out and gives it to Cornyn.

CORNYN
(grabbing the card)
Now y'all listen close, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.
(beat)
Leave town *immediately* and go back to wherever the hell you came from.

Fireman #2 grins.

FIREMAN #2
Thanks for the weed.

Cornyn points to his eyes. We see a brief flash of yellow, almost like the eyes of a snake.

CUT TO:

We see Markus' terrified face. Did he just see Cornyn's eyes flash yellow, or was it just the drugs?

CUT BACK TO:

CORNYN
We'll be watching.

The two firemen exit the motel room.

Markus, Jamal and Sophie stare at each other in stunned silence.

MARKUS
His eyes, man --

SOPHIE
Well, that was scary.

JAMAL
Idiots didn't know we already uploaded it.


# 2017 -- Death of Tracie Merril
EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX (2017) -- SUNSET, CONNIE STANTON'S APARTMENT
SUPER: "THREE YEARS AGO"

We see a squat, brown apartment building with outdoor stairwells. In the background, a baby cries.

INT. CONNIE STANTON'S APARTMENT (2017) -- SUNSET

We are now in Connie Stanton's apartment. It is well kept, but small. We see a wall showing her various accomplishments -- a bachelor's degree, a photo of Connie with her bowling championship team, etc.

Connie empties a box of items taken from her desk when she was fired as town clerk. Connie wears a nightgown, slippers, and she has her hair up. She humms a pop song.

As she removes a bowling championship plaque from the box, a small item CLATTERS on the floor.

CUT TO:

We see a closeup of the item -- it is a USB THUMB DRIVE, with a skull and crossbones on it. It is the same thumb drive that Jacob was using on her computer.

CONNIE
There you are!

CUT TO:

Connie is now at a desk in her apartment. A cat is curled up on her lap. A steaming cup of tea is nearby. Connie plugs the USB THUMB DRIVE into her laptop.

CONNIE
Now, let's see what you were doing poking around my cubicle, *I.T boy**.


The thumb drive's light BLINKS.

CUT TO:

Connie scans the computer screen. We only see her eyes. Suddenly, they go wide.

CONNIE
What the heck?
(beat)
You have got to be kidding me!

CUT TO:
Still looking at the screen, Connie reaches behind her and grabs her phone, nearly knocking her mug of tea over.

CONNIE
I'm gonna kill him!

Connie dials. Her cat meows, and jumps to the floor.

CONNIE
Come on --
(beat)
come on!

The line TRILLS, but nobody picks up.


EXT. TOWN HALL, PARKING LOT (2017) -- SUNSET

Mayor Tracie Merril exits the back door of Emmet Town Hall. It is the end of a working day as the sun sets. Tracie looks haggard. She wears a winter hat. She shakes as she reaches into her embroidered purse to grab a set of keys.

Tracie locks the door, and begins descending the ramp to the parking lot, grasping onto the handrail for dear life.

She pauses for a moment, clutching her chest, and breathing heavily. Then continues.

INT. TOWN HALL, MAYOR'S OFFICE (2017) -- SUNSET

We see a closeup of Mayor Tracie's PHONE SWITCHBOARD on her desk. A light blinks, and Connie's voice comes in over the ANSWERING MACHINE.

CONNIE (V.O)
Ms. Mayor? If you're there, please, PLEASE pick up! 
(pause)
God, okay. You're not going to believe this until I show you.

We see Tracie through a window in the background, unaware of the message on her machine.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL, PARKING LOT (2017) -- SUNSET

While Tracie slowly descends the ramp, Connie's voice continues through the answering machine.

CONNIE (V.O)
Reggie Gunn is swindling you. Dangit, he's swindling the whole town!

Tracie stops, and squints.

CUT TO:

A TEXAS HORNED LIZARD (a small, squat, draconic-looking beast) sits right in the middle of the parking lot ramp, basking in the setting sun. It blocks Tracie's progress. A DISTURBING, DISCORDANT GROWL builds.

Tracie bends down, groaning, still grasping the handrail.

TRACIE
(gleeful)
Good grief! A horny toad!

Connie's voice continues over the answering machine.

CONNIE (V.O)
Tracie, Mr. Gunn stole all those water payments and put them right into his business account!
(beat)
And I think he's been embezzling construction contracts.

Tracie reaches out her shaking index finger toward the horned lizard. The GROWL grows louder.

TRACIE
Scoot!
(beat)
Skidaddle, you varmint!

She waves at the creature. It seems not to notice.

CONNIE (V.O)
You need to get ahead of this before the police blame you --
(beat)
or me --

Suddenly, the horned lizard SQUIRTS bright red BLOOD from its eyes right into Tracie's face! *(Believe it or not, this is something this creature can do)*.

TRACIE
(Screaming)
Ah!

She is blinded! Tracie slumps forward onto the ground, clutching her chest. The GROWL is almost deafening now.

CUT TO:

We see a closeup of the horned lizard's blood-shot eyes as Connie's voiceover continues.


CONNIE (V.O)
Please pick up...
(beat)
I'm scared.

The horned lizard SKITTERS out of frame.

CUT TO:

We pull away from Tracie's lifeless body and lift into the sky as the soundtrack fades away.

# 2020 -- Choosing to Stay
INT. MOTEL ROOM (2020) -- DAY

SUPER: "PRESENT DAY"

Jamal, Markus and Sophie are in the motel room. Markus looks out the curtains nervously while Sophie rocks on the bed. Jamal paces.

MARKUS
(quavering)
I don't know man, we gotta get out of here.

SOPHIE
Yep, I'm definitely not interested. No thank you.

Jamal looks at Markus' laptop. The laptop screen shows the YouTube page with Markus' viral video on it.

JAMAL
This could be a good thing for us. We could work with this.

MARKUS
(looking out the window)
Are you kidding, dude? They're *watching* us. Lizard people, man! I saw his eyes!

JAMAL
We just went viral. Forget about Big Foot -- we need to do a documentary on this town.

Sophie slams Markus' laptop shut.

SOPHIE
No. Veto.

JAMAL
Who gave you veto power?

MARKUS
The constitution, man!

SOPHIE
We made one viral video. That's good enough for me. No need to get axe-murdered by hillbilly yokels.

Jamal sighs.

JAMAL
Nobody is getting *murdered*. Look, we're just doing a show. 

Jamal paces around the room.

JAMAL (CONTINUED)
Why don't we shoot our footage with Jim Simmons, throw in some bullshit about lizard people conspiracies --

Markus interrupts.

MARKUS
Not bullshit. Real shit.

JAMAL (CONTINUED)
Whatever -- 
(beat)
-- and our actual, *real-life* experiences of being robbed by the police *and* fire department? It'd be like, real journalism.

SOPHIE
You suddenly care about *real journalism*? The same Jamal who made a high school music video featuring a singing CGI walrus?

MARKUS
Hey, that slapped!

Markus imitates the singing walrus. It is truly terrible.

JAMAL
Real journalism or not, I think we're on to something.

SOPHIE
Besides, what does Jim Simmons have to do with this? The town isn't run by Big Foot.

JAMAL
You said it yourself, he had a "rant" in our YouTube comments, right?

Sophie scrolls through her phone.

SOPHIE
Yeah, I mean, holy cow look at it.

She turns her phone toward Jamal.

CUT TO:

Jim Simmons has written a multi-paragraph jeremiad in the youtube comments. This image flashes on screen briefly, just enough to see that it is a crazy rant in all-caps.

JIM SIMMONS (excerpt)
"...THIS WHOLE REGION HAS BEEN RUN BY REPTILIANS FOR YEARS! PEOPLE ARE JUST STARTING TO SEE THE TRUTH! LOOK AT THE EYES OF THIS OFFICER. HE COVERS THEM WITH SUNGLASSES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT US TO SEE THE TRUTH. REPTILLIAN SPACE SHIPS FROM THE PLANET EXAR FIVE FIRST LANDED IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE IN 1967. I HAVE A PIECE OF THAT SHIP! ..."

CUT TO:

Sophie considers her options, looking at the phone, and back at Jamal.

SOPHIE
Ok, now that it's over, I think it's kind of funny.

MARKUS
Funny? Those dicks stole my weed!

Jamal and Sophie laugh.

JAMAL
Say what you will about our Big Foot Hunter; but he's entertaining. He drives views. He probably really wants to talk to us.

SOPHIE
Do you still have his number?

JAMAL
Yeah. I texted him last night to say we wouldn't make it.

MARKUS
I don't know man, I don't know. I got a real bad feeling about this. This goes *deep*, man.

JAMAL
It's going to be ok. What's the worst that could happen?

Jamal dials a number on his phone.

# 2017 -- Just Intimidate Her
INT. FUNERAL HOME (2017) -- DAY

>TITLE CARD (Overlay)
"THREE YEARS AGO"

Tracie's corpse lays in an open casket. She has on fancy clothing and jewelry. She looks glowing. Soft FUERARY MUSIC plays on an organ out of frame.

A pair of older women wearing black dresses (TRACIE'S DAUGHTER and Diane) stand over the casket. One of the women dabs her eyes with a handkerchief.

TRACIE'S DAUGHTER
Oh mama, you look so beautiful!

DIANE
Why didn't she just retire? She could have had so many good years.

TRACIE'S DAUGHTER
(sobbing)
She had so much love in her heart. She had some left over for this town.

Officer Craig Lang, wearing an ill-fitting black suit, approaches from behind the women. Cynthia Lang holds his hand. As the women leave the casket, Officer Lang nods at them.

LANG
(mumbling)
So sorry for your loss.

Lang and Cynthia approach the casket.

CYNTHIA
(peering over the edge of the casket)
Oh...

LANG
(whispering)
I told you not to look, sweet-pea.

Cynthia looks up at her father.

CYNTHIA
What'd she die from?

LANG
(whispering)
Oh, uh, heart attack, I think. She was super old. I don't know, like eighty? Older than Grandpa.

CYNTHIA
Woah.

Lang and Cynthia leave the casket. As they leave, Connie Stanton, in full funerary attire, passes them. She glances at Lang before stopping at the casket.

CONTINUOUS TO:

We follow Lang and Cynthia as they walk past funeral-goers sitting in pews. The place looks quite crowded.

Lang and Cynthia start to sit down at a pew next to Jenna Lang when Reggie Gunn HISSES from off screen.

REGGIE
(whispering)
Psst! Craig!

CUT TO:

Reggie hides in the back of the funeral home, in all black. He wears sunglasses. He looks pretty weird. For one thing, his head bleeds. Small rivulets of blood roll down his forehead.

He motions for Lang to come over.

CUT TO:

Reggie and Lang stand at the back of the funeral home. Reggie looks nervous. He keeps glancing over his shoulder.

LANG
(whispering)
What the fuck happened to your head, my guy?

Reggie seems surprised. He wipes his forehead with a bloody handkerchief.

REGGIE
Never mind that. We got things to talk about.

LANG
Can't it wait? My wife and kid are here.

Reggie lowers his sunglasses, revealing bloodshot eyes.

ABRUPT CUT TO:

We see a flash of the HORNED LIZARD that was present during Tracie's death. Its eyes are bloody.

CUT BACK TO:

REGGIE
Mayor's dead.

LANG
Yeah bud, I can see that --

REGGIE
Town council's got to elect an acting mayor now. And I have every intention of winnin' that election.

LANG
(incredulous)
*You* want to be mayor?

REGGIE
Yes sir. And if I win, I'm making you my chief of police.

LANG
(beat)
Ok? Thanks?

Reggie whispers through gritted teeth.

REGGIE
But first, we need to keep outta *jail*!

CUT TO:
Connie Stanton finishes saying her goodbyes to the Mayor, and begins walking back to her pew.

CUT TO:
Reggie pushes his sunglasses back on.

REGGIE
*Fuck*. She's here.

LANG
Who's here?

REGGIE
The *clerk*. Stanton.

LANG
So what?

Reggie grabs ahold of Lang's wrist and pulls him further into the shadows. He then pulls a CASSETTE TAPE out of his pocket.

REGGIE
She knows!

LANG
Oh shit. You mean about --?

REGGIE
Yeah, about our business. About --
(beat)
fucking everything.

LANG
What do we do?

REGGIE
I want you to deal with her.

LANG
What? No. No way. I'm not going to -- are you suggesting I'm going to --

Reggie cuts him off, waving the cassette in his face.

REGGIE
Just scare her. I just want her intimidated, at least until after the general election.

Lang makes a face of disgust.

LANG
You want me to scare that lady? How is that gonna help?

REGGIE
I still owe you forty thousand dollars, and you've already taken twenty. Don't forget that, "chief". I'm in this. You're in this.

Lang looks over at Connie.

CUT TO:

Connie sits quietly at her pew.

CUT TO:
Lang turns back to reggie.

LANG
Ok. I'll talk to her.

REGGIE
Today. Follow her home if you have to. Don't make a scene here.

LANG
Ok. Ok. I'll do it today.

REGGIE
Bingo.

LANG
I'm just gonna talk to her.

Blood rolls down Reggie's forehead.

REGGIE
Just talk.

EXT. OFFICER LANG'S HOUSE (2017) -- NIGHT

The Lang family car pulls up in front of the Lang household. Officer Lang, Jenna and Cynthia exit the car. Lang's black tie is undone, dangling around his neck like a lanyard.

JENNA
Alright hon', I'm going to freshen up and we ought head out to Aunt Norah's.

LANG
Oh yeah, the Sunday board game thing?

JENNA
Yep! And we've got to pick up Martin.

CYNTHIA
I want to play Ticket to Ride!

LANG
You know what, baby? As much as I want to be a train baron, and as much as I love *destroying* Norah, I'm actually pretty beat.

JENNA
You're not coming?

LANG
Nah, sorry. I've got to take a nap.

Lang imitates a snore. Cynthia giggles. The family walks up to the front door of the house.

JENNA
Okay! Do you need the car?

LANG
Oh? Nah. If I need to go out, I'll use the hog.

Lang ruffles Cynthia's hair.

LANG
But you, my little princess, are going to build a train empire.

CYNTHIA
I'll get longest train!

JENNA
Sure.

Cynthia enters the house, and Jenna puts a hand out to stop Craig Lang from entering.

JENNA
When I get back, we need to talk.

LANG
Uh oh -- dreaded words!

JENNA
Nothing serious, I just want to talk about the last credit card statement.

Lang cracks a nervous smile.

LANG
Our anniversary is coming up.

JENNA
Oh, no. It's not that. I told you, nothing serious. But we need to go over it.

LANG
Gotcha.
(beat)
Y'know what? I'll be in the garage.

JENNA
Bye!

INT. GARAGE (2017) -- NIGHT

Craig Lang stands at the workbench of his garage. There are power tools and boxes spread in front of him.

Lang shuffles some boxes to the side, and mumbles to himself.

LANG
(mumbling)
"Just talk to her" he says ... just talk. What a creep.

Lang grabs a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY and a glass that was hidden behind a power tool box on the workbench. He looks behind him through the open garage door to see Jenna and Cynthia pulling away in the car.

LANG
(mumbling)
My guy's a maniac.

Lang drinks whiskey directly from the bottle. He pulls out another box from a shelf on the workbench. It is a plastic case with a prominent logo reading "AXON X4" on the front.

CUT TO:

We see Lang's hands open the container with a CLICK. He gingerly opens it up. The bright yellow TASER GUN rests inside.

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX (2017) -- NIGHT

Officer Lang pulls into the parking lot of Connie Stanton's apartment building on his motorcycle. He wears his police uniform, but it's unkempt, and misbuttoned. He parks the motorcycle.

INT. CONNIE STANTON'S APARTMENT (2017) -- NIGHT

We see Connie's apartment. There are papers all over her desk, including a prominently displayed Manila folder, labeled "REGGIE - EVIDENCE." Her cat rests on a carpeted cat playground.

Connie is in her tiny kitchen, making dinner. She places a salmon on a baking sheet.

We hear a BEAT on the door. BEAT. BEAT. BEAT. in rapid succession.

LANG (O.S)
(muffled)
Open up! It's the police!

Connie startles, and drops the baking sheet on the counter.

CONNIE
(shouting)
Oh okay! Okay! I'm coming!

INT. HALLWAY (2017) -- NIGHT
Lang stands in the hallway. He is about to beat on the door when Connie opens it up slightly, the chain still on the door.

CONNIE
Do you need something, officer?

Lang lowers his fist. He composes himself. He is not obviously drunk.

LANG
I just need to talk to you. You're Ms. Connie Stanton?

CONNIE
About what, officer?

Lang sighs.

LANG
It's uh, the thing with the water, ma'am.

CONNIE
Yes?

She peers through the gap in the door, not flinching, not daring to open it.

LANG
You left a ...
(mumbling)
report? On the mayor's answering machine. I need to take a statement.

Connie begins to undo the chain lock on the door.

CONNIE
I did.

LANG
There were some serious, uh ... *allegations* in that report.

Connie opens the door, letting Lang in.

INT. CONNIE STANTON'S APARTMENT (2017) -- NIGHT

Lang enters the apartment. He looks up and sees the cat on the cat playground.

LANG
Nice cat. What's her name?

CONNIE
*His* name is Julio.

LANG
(laughs)
Julio. Cute.

Connie seems put off by his disposition. Something isn't right.

CONNIE
(flatly)
You wanted to take a statement?

Lang shuts the door behind him.

LANG
Yes ma'am. You're not in trouble.

CONNIE
I never said I was in trouble.

A tense moment occurs between them they face off in Connie's small apartment. Lang removes a notepad from his belt, and a pen.

LANG
Ok, well. Uh, you're accusing Mr. Reggie Gunn of uh, stealing?

Connie grabs the Manila folder from the desk.

CONNIE
Yes, sir. He's been stealing payments from our water system. It's obvious, actually. Stupid.

LANG
(motioning at the folder)
Uh huh, and that's, uh ...?

Connie taps the folder.

CONNIE
I've got all the documentation right here. Racketeering. Fraud. Embezzlement.
(beat)
His son is in on it too, I think.

Lang sets his notepad down.

LANG
Can I see that?

Connie hesitates, and then hands Lang the folder. A tense pause passes as Lang stares blankly at the folder.

CONNIE
I was going to report him tomorrow. I want to be absolutely sure, especially after the Mayor (bless her heart) died.

Lang sets the Manila folder next to his notepad, then turns toward Connie.

LANG
No.

CONNIE
No?

LANG
I'll write this up. You just keep, uh, you keep your mouth shut.

CONNIE
(offended)
Excuse me?

LANG
I don't want you poking around Reggie's business anymore.

Connie looks alarmed. She scans the room, looking for an exit.

CONNIE
Wait a minute. I've seen you coaching soccer with Reggie. Who are you again?

LANG
I'm Craig.

Connie sniffs the air with palpable suspicion.

CONNIE
Are you *drunk*?

LANG
No ma'am --

Connie moves past him, reaching for the Manila folder.

CONNIE
*I'll* report it --

Lang drunkenly SHOVES Connie back, nearly knocking her over.

CONNIE
Ow!

LANG
Stand back!

Lang reaches for his TASER on his belt and raises it, but in doing so he STUMBLES backwards into the cat tower.

Julio the cat SCREECHES, and lands on Craig Lang's head.

LANG
(screaming)
Ah! Ah! Get off!

Lang freaks out, swatting at the ANGRY CAT. In doing so, he accidentally FIRES the taser at Connie.

We hear a WHOOSH and then a TICKING NOISE as the leads of the taser gun land on Connie Stanton.

Connie CONVULSES, and then collapses to the floor with a THUD. Julio leaps off of Lang's head.

All is quiet now. Lang stands over an unconscious Connie. He has a cat scratch on his cheek.

LANG
(quietly)
Oh no. Oh... 
(beat)
Jesus forgive me.

Lang pulls the taser away. He then looks around the room, sees the Manila evidence folder and picks it up. As he rummages, Connie begins to rouse.

CONNIE
(groaning)
What ... happened?

LANG
Stay away from Reggie Gunn!

CONNIE
What?

She tries to get up, but collapses to the floor again.

LANG
Stay out of this, or I'll be back!

Lang sheds a tear. He takes one last look at Connie, and then exits her apartment, slamming the door behind him.

# 2020 -- Jim Simmons
EXT. SIMMONS' RANCH (2020) -- DAY

>TITLE CARD (Overlay)
"PRESENT DAY"

The college students' van trundles down an unpaved dirt road amidst scrubland. The van passes a sign reading "COME BACK WITH A WARRANT." In the background, brown Texas Longhorn cattle MOO.

As the van drives by, a lone SECURITY CAMERA follows them, WHIRRING.

INT. VAN (2020) -- DAY

We are looking out the windshield of the van as Sophie drives it. The van SPUTTERS. The college students see a ranch house at the end of the road, flanked by solar panels and windmills.

MARKUS
Cool, he's off the grid.

Jamal films through the windshield with his camera.

CUT TO:

We now see the scene through Jamal's camera.

SOPHIE
(to the camera)
Hello subscribers! When you last heard from us, we'd just been robbed by both the police and fire departments. Rather than run away, or anything sensible like that, we decided to pay Jim Simmons a visit.

Sophie steers the van over cattle grates.

SOPHIE (CONTINUED)
(to the camera)
We're coming in to the Simmons' ranch now -- does our mysterious cryptid hunter really have Big Foot in his freezer? Let's find out.

The van makes a loud BANG.

JAMAL
That didn't sound good.

SOPHIE
We better not get stranded here.

CUT TO:
EXT. SIMMONS' RANCH (2020) -- DAY

The van pulls in front of the ranch house, and parks next to a massive pickup truck with tinted windows. TINA SIMMONS (a woman in her 50's, cheery, a homemaker) exits the ranch house. 

She has on an apron reading "Kitchen Queen", and is wearing an oven mitt.

TINA
(from afar)
Howdy, kids!

The college students exit the van. Jamal turns his camera off.

SOPHIE
Hi! I'm Sophie. This is Jamal and Markus. We're the ones who called earlier about filming a documentary? It's called the *Weird and the Wild*.

TINA
Welcome to the ranch! I'm Tina Simmons.

JAMAL
Hey.

TINA (CONTINUED)
You're just in time for supper. Hope you like prime rib!

CUT TO:
INT. SIMMONS' RANCH KITCHEN (2020) -- DAY

Tina opens up an oven in the Simmons' ranch kitchen, and pulls out a rack of ribs. Sophie, Jamal and Markus enter, dragging recording equipment with them.

TINA
(placing the ribs)
Y'all some more kids come to see Big Foot?

SOPHIE
Yeah, sorry we missed you yesterday Mrs. Simmons. We were -- really busy.

Tina wipes her apron, and sets the oven mitts down.

TINA
Oh, that's alright. Jim's just so excited to talk to you. You know how he gets -- the slightest bit of attention gets him up in the morning.

Tina sets out plates on the table, and begins to shovel ribs onto a plate.

JAMAL
Thanks for the meal, ma'am.

Markus DROPS a microphone by accident. It makes a CLACK as it falls on the kitchen floor.

MARKUS
Uh, sorry.

Markus picks up the microphone and stops to look at a PHOTOGRAPH of JIM SIMMONS (a bulky man in his 50's wearing oakley sunglasses and sporting a goatee) holding a fish. In the photograph, Jim looks proud.

MARKUS (CONTINUED)
Where, uh ...
(looking around)
 is he?

 TINA
 Oh, Jim's just down playing in his *man cave*.

 Tina makes knowing eyes at Sophie, who seems confused.

 TINA
 Usually he can't be bothered to come up. I gotta bring his supper down.

 JAMAL
 Does Jim really have Big Foot's corpse in a freezer?

 Tina sighs. She motions to a freezer in the back fo the kitchen. It's huge and grimy.

 TINA
 You be the judge.

 [BEGIN CAMERA POV] CUT TO:

 Jamal films while Sophie opens the FREEZER. Inside is an unidentifiable mush of meat and hair. We see this from the perspective of Jamal's camera.

 SOPHIE
 Ew.

She turns toward the camera.

SOPHIE (CONTINUED)
Well, there you have it, folks. Sasquatch. In the -- *flesh*?

Jim Simmons interrupts from off screen.

JIM SIMMONS (O.S)
Y'all have *no idea* what it cost me to get ahold of her.

Jamal turns the camera toward a dark hallway. Jim stands there, creepily.

[END CAMERA POV] CUT TO:

Jamal, Markus and Sophie stand next to the freezer. Markus holds a boom mike and a plate of ribs simultaneously, somehow.

Jim steps out of the shadows while Jamal continues to film.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
And I ain't talking about money.

Jim SLAMS the freezer shut. Sophie JUMPS.

SOPHIE
Um ... Mr. Simmons?

JIM SIMMONS
Y'all alone? Were ya *followed*?

Sophie isn't sure what to say.

TINA
(to Jim)
Honey bunches, your ribs are ready!

Jim sniffs the air like a caged animal.

JIM SIMMONS
Thank you kindly. I'll eat it in my *command center*.

Tina hands Jim a plate of ribs.

TINA
Don't forget your fork!

Jim grunts.

JIM SIMMONS
(to Sophie)
Come along kids. Command center's downstairs.

CUT TO:
INT. SIMMONS' RANCH COMMAND CENTER (2020) -- DAY

Jim leads the college students down dingy basement stairs he punches a 4 digit code on a keypad -- BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. Jim tries to keep anyone from seeing the code by blocking the keypad with his hand. The door beyond CHUNKS, and opens. Markus acts like he's in Disney World, audibly gasping at the pagentry.

CUT TO:

Jim leads the college students into an underground bunker. The lighting is low. Computer monitors and corkboards line the walls. Security cameras show live feeds on some of the monitors. There is a prominent gun case.

Markus passes a DISPLAY CASE with a weird mummified animal in it. He taps the glass, leaving a smudge of sauce where he tapped.

MARKUS
Woah.

JIM SIMMONS
Don't touch that!

Jim gets between Markus and the display case. He rubs off the sauce stain Markus left with his shirt.

JIM SIMMONS
Baby *chupacabra*. Mummified. Found it on Bautista's ranch. Still waitin' on the D.N.A results.

Markus seems intrigued, but pulls his hand back.

Jim sets his plate of ribs down in front of a row of old-fashioned CRT computer monitors.

JIM SIMMONS
A'ight. Let's do this.

CUT TO:

Jim stands in front of a row of sliding corkboards in his dark lair. The corkboards are covered in newspaper clippings, old photographs and of course, red strings.

Sophie stands nearby as Jamal films and Markus holds a boom mic.

SOPHIE
So, Mr. Simmons. How would you describe your profession?

JIM SIMMONS
I'm a hunter.

SOPHIE
And what do you hunt, exactly?

Jim points at images on a corkboard.

JIM SIMMONS
Oh, a bunch of things: sasquatch, goat men, skunk ape, mothman, reptillians.

His finger glides across grainy images and silly drawings of various beasts pegged on the cork board.

SOPHIE
Wow, that's ... a lot. Do you really believe in all these mythical animals?

JIM SIMMONS
Wrong question.

SOPHIE
I'm sorry?

Jim paces in front of the board, Jamal struggles to keep the camera on him.

JIM SIMMONS
I believe in the *people* -- regular people. Credible people. People who know what they saw.

Jim SLIDES a corkboard in from the ceiling -- it's on rails. The mechanism CLANKS. He shows us a map of the United States, covered in a rainbow of pushpins.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Each one of them dots is a report, sent to me personally, by folks all around the country.

Jim points at a dot on the East coast.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
A lady gets lost while camping in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. She's looking for her dog, see? But she's got all turned around. She's scared.

His finger traces a red string from the pin in New Jersey to a drawing of RED EYES in a black frame that has been pinned to the corkboard.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
She calls out for the dog. She hears a yelp.
(beat)
That's the part nobody contests, not even the police.

He taps the picture of the eyes.

SOPHIE
What's that? A Coyote?

JIM SIMMONS
That's what she saw next. Red eyes. Glowing. She saw horns. Devil horns.

SOPHIE
The ... *Jersey Devil*?

JIM SIMMONS
Exactly. Not the hockey one. The real deal. The Jersey Devil ate her dog that night.

Jim motions at the map full of pushpins.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Nobody believed her. Folks called her nuts. Hysterical. But you know what? She *knew what she saw.*
(beat)
And it wasn't no Coyote.

SOPHIE
And the other pins?

JIM SIMMONS
Hundreds -- thousands of people who saw something. They come to me because I believe them when there ain't nobody else who does.

SOPHIE
Wow, so you follow up on all of these?

Jim nods.

JIM SIMMONS
You can tell when folks are lying. Or when they're a *plant*.

SOPHIE
What do you mean?

Jim gets uncomfortably close to Sophie.

JIM SIMMONS
You know *exactly* what I mean.

Tina calls down from the stairwell.

TINA
(cheerily, from afar)
Honeybunches, you done with your ribs?

JIM SIMMONS
(shouting)
Not now, woman! I'm spreading the truth!

TINA
(from afar)
Oh okay, I'll come back later.

Jim looks at the cork board and mutters inaudibly to himself.

Markus pokes Sophie with the boom mic.

SOPHIE
Ow! Watch it!

Markus whispers to Sophie.

MARKUS
(whispering)
Ask him about the lizard people!

Sophie sighs.

SOPHIE
Um, Mr. Simmons? Recently you posted some ... findings to our social media accounts about, well, Reptillians?

Jim turns back from the corkboards.

JIM SIMMONS
Let me show you something.

CUT TO:

Jim stands in front of a row of beige CRT computer monitors. He pushes a button on one of the monitors. The YouTube video Markus posted plays on the screen.

JIM SIMMONS
I admire what you kids are doing. Speaking truth to power. Making the world finally *see*.
(beat)
But y'all stumbled into a den of vipers. The very *center* of offworld infiltration in this nation.

Jim pauses the video on a frame of Officer Craig Lang pulling a TASER on Jamal. The image is distorted and fuzzy.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Take a look at this officer. See how he draws the taser? His arm is *flopping* around, almost like it's a *puppet*.

SOPHIE
Well, he was drunk.

Jim clicks a mouse, and the image on the CRT screen zooms in on Lang's distorted face.

JIM SIMMONS
And his *eyes*. They're covered behind dark glasses.

SOPHIE
Sunglasses. It was bright out.

JIM SIMMONS
A *reptillian* won't let you see his eyes. The eyes give him away.

ABRUPT CUT TO:

We see a brief flash of Reggie taking off his sunglasses at Tracie Merill's funeral, revealing his bloodshot eyes.

CUT BACK TO:

SOPHIE
What?

JIM SIMMONS
That officer? He's the chief of police in Emmett, and he robbed ya on the highway. Odd case of corruption, or something bigger?

SOPHIE
We also got robbed by a couple of, I don't know, firemen?

Jim's eyes widen.

CUT TO:

Jim frantically pulls another cork board down on rails. This one is covered with newspaper clippings, and a SPIDER DIAGRAM featuring photographs -- headshots of various people around Emmett. He holds a long wooden stick, and uses it as a pointer.

He points at a photo in the spider diagram labeled "CORNYN". It is a grainy photo of Fire Marshall Cornyn.

JIM SIMMONS
Was it *him*?

SOPHIE
(surprised)
Yeah!

Jim breathes in deeply, preparing for a rehearsed speech. He SLAPS the corkboard with his wooden stick.

JIM SIMMONS
Exhibit A!

CUT TO:

We see an old, yellowed newspaper clipping with a headline reading:

"Space METEOR causes false alarm -- not Soviets Says Air Force Colnel"

JIM SIMMONS (V.O)
April third 1967, Emmet Texas. Residents report strange lights in the sky. An explosion!

CUT TO:
Jim drags a display case from the corner in front of the corkboard. It SQUEAKS as he drags it. Inside the glass is a CHARRED PIECE of METAL.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Air force tried to cover it up! Said it was just a meteor.

CUT TO:

We see a closeup of the charred piece of metal as Jim motions to it. It looks sort of weird, but not obviously alien.

JIM SIMMONS
Does this look like a *meteor() to you?

CUT TO:
Sophie seems unimpressed.

SOPHIE
I don't know. What is it?

She squints at the charred metal, her face reflected in the glass.

JIM SIMMONS
I recovered this artifact with the help of a metal detect'rist near here. I believe it's from the crash.

SOPHIE
Crash?

JIM SIMMONS
That wasn't no *meteor*, it was an alien spacecraft!

Markus can't contain himself.

MARKUS (O.S)
Hell yeah!

Sophie shoots Markus a look of disapproval.

SOPHIE
Sorry, what does this have to do with the drunk cop?

CUT TO:

Jim aggressively smacks the center of the spider diagram on his corkboard. It is a shadowy face with a question mark over it.

JIM SIMMONS
Exhibit B!

He RIPS the picture off the corkboard, revealing a black-and-white photo of a younger Reggie Gunn underneath.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Reginald E. Gunn. The mayor of Emmett Texas, manager of Gunn Heavy Lifting LLC, and former treasurer of that very same town; where, in 1967 an *alien spacecraft* crash landed.

Jim points to another section of the corkboard, featuring old typewritten documents.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Mr. Gunn rose to power in late 2017, after the previous mayor --

Jim points at a photo of Tracie Merril, which is linked by a red string to the photo of Reggie Gunn.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Mrs. Tracie Merill -- died under *mysterious circumstances.*

SOPHIE
Uh, can you slow down? I thought we were talking about the firemen?

JIM SIMMONS
-- I'll get to that. Don't interrupt.

He TEARS the photo of Reggie off the board, revealing a newer photo of Reggie underneath. He looks haggared, tired, with a bad combover and an ill fitting shirt.

JIM SIMMONS
Mr. Gunn in early 2017. Older. How old would you say? About 50?

He TEARS the next photo off the board, revealing an even newer photo of Reggie. This time, Reggie has long, quaffed blonde hair, a fancy suit, and jewelry. In the photo, he stands in front of a sign reading "Reginald Gunn Playground."

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
2018. Notice the difference? He's younger. Practically *glowing*.
(beat)
Now how does becoming mayor make a man *younger*?

SOPHIE
Maybe he got a toupee?

Jim slaps a picture of Craig Lang on the spider diagram.

JIM SIMMONS
After becoming mayor, Mr. Gunn hires Craig Lang and chief of police -- the man who robbed y'all. Soon after, much of the rest of the police force calls it quits. 

Jim's stick lands on a picture of Cornyn.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
The volunteer fire department is *converted* into a salaried position.
(beat)
This man, Cornyn, becomes fire marshall.

Jim taps another photo, this time of a burning gas station.

SOPHIE
That's him! That's the guy who threatened us this morning.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
He don't put out fires. Some say he starts them instead.

Jim sighs.

JIM SIMMONS
These ain't the actions of good men. They ain't the actions of *men* at all.

SOPHIE
I don't know, the people who got drunk and robbed us were definitely all dudes.

Jim ignores her point with the wave of a hand.

JIM SIMMONS
The real kicker is this. I have obtained Mr. Gunn's birth records. 

SOPHIE
Really? How?

JIM SIMMONS
Don't ask me how. That's priveledged information.
(beat)
Mr. Gunn's date of birth? April 3rd, 1967. The place? Not far from Emmett.

Jim SLIDES down a final corkboard. This one is covered in ridiculous drawings of half-human half-lizard creatures. Schizophrenic writing covers the images.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Reptillians. You know about 'em?

SOPHIE
Uh, sort of. What are they?

JIM SIMMONS
Nobody's quite sure *what* they are exactly, but we do know what they *do*.

Jim points out a drawing of a lizard-headed Egyptian god in a a picture of an old heiroglyph.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
Reptillians infiltrate human societies. They imitate regular folk by wearing human suits.

Jim's stick points at a drawing of a lizard person sitting on a throne, with people in ancient garb worshiping it.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
When they come into a region, they gain the trust of folks who live there. Eventually, they become rulers. Kings. Emporers. *Mayors*. It happens all over the world.

SOPHIE
But why?

Jim chuckles knowingly, and shakes his head. He points his stick at a gruesome European dark ages drawing of a lizard-like demon swallowing a person whole.

JIM SIMMONS
They ain't like you or I. They're *cold blooded*. They need the blood of live human *victims*, preferably young, to keep themselves runnin'. 

SOPHIE
Gross. And you think that in Emmett...?

Jim SLIDES the corkboard away, showing the image of Reggie Gunn. He taps it.

JIM SIMMONS
Reggie Gunn wasn't *born* here. He *crashed* in that spacecraft in 1967. Ever since, he's been tryin' to grasp onto power as hard as he can. He's invited his so called "friends" --

He taps the picture of Craig Lang.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
And his "relatives" --

He taps a scool photo of Jacob Gunn.

JIM SIMMONS (CONTINUED)
To join in on the feast. Ever since then, Emmett has become a ghost town -- the people that "left?" They were his victims. His "glow up?" Just the result of eating lotsa fresh meat!

A tense moment passes.

SOPHIE
Wild.

JIM SIMMONS
That's  my theory, anyway.

SOPHIE
But do you have any hard evidence? Anything you want to show the world?

Jim paces in front of the corkboards.

JIM SIMMONS
I have informants -- no, I won't name them -- who I've hired to keep tabs on the leadership of this town. They've been following Gunn for months.
